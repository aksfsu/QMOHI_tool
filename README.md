# QMOMI_tool
  Student Health Centers (SHCs) websites of U.S. colleges and universities are considered high-quality and credible sources of health information by students. Although most SHC clinics comply with American College Health Association (ACHA) standards, the quality control of online health information on SHC websites is not implemented by any central governing body.  
  To address this issue, we propose a new tool, QMOMI: Quantitative Measures of Online Medical Information, an open-source specialty tool that provides an efficient and multi-faceted health information quality assessment of SHC websites. QMOMI is designed and developed as a modular pipeline of three components: SHC website identification, Information collection, Quality assessment. QMOMI simply needs the university name(s) and topic(s) of interest, in the form of keyword(s), to quantify the quality of information about these topics that is posted on the SHC websites. In the first component, given university name(s) is/are used to identify the corresponding SHC website. SHC website homepages along with the set of input keyword(s) act as entry point to the second component where information related to the keywords is scraped from the SHC websites. Once we have relevant information, the third component quantifies its quality through metrics such as Readability, Objectivity, Polarity, Coverage, Similarity, and Prevalence. Accessibility and recency of the information is represented by Navigation and Timeliness metrics, respectively. 
  QMOMI tool is designed 1) to be highly efficient, scalable and repeatable so as to enable longitudinal large-scale studies that involve numerous SHC websites, 2) to be generalizable so as to enable information quality studies on any topic, and 3) to be immune to human biases by completely automating the quality quantification process. With these properties QMOMI can be used by public health administrators, researchers and practitioners to undertake nation-wide research studies, and potentially be adopted by American College Health Association (ACHA) to extend their services to SHC websites.  This project illustrates a fruitful application of computing technology to the field of public health.
