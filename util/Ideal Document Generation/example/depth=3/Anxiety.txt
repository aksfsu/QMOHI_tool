What is sleep? While you are sleeping, you are unconscious, but your brain and body functions are still active. Sleep is a complex biological process that helps you process new information, stay healthy, and feel rested. During sleep, your brain cycles through five stages: stage 1, 2, 3, 4, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Different things happen during each stage. For example, you have a different pattern of brain waves during each one. Your breathing, heart, and temperature may be slower or faster in some stages. Certain phases of sleep help you : Feel rested and energetic the next day Learn information, get insight, and form memories Give your heart and vascular system a rest Release more growth hormone, which helps children grow. It also boosts muscle mass and the repair of cells and tissues in children and adults. Release sex hormones, which contributes to puberty and fertility Keep from getting sick or help you get better when you are sick, by creating more cytokines (hormones that help the immune system fight various infections) You need all of the stages to get a healthy sleep. How much sleep do I need? The amount of sleep you need depends on several factors, including your age, lifestyle, health, and whether you have been getting enough sleep recently. The general recommendations for sleep are: Newborns: 16-18 hours a day Preschool-aged children: 11-12 hours a day School-aged children: At least 10 hours a day Teens: 9-10 hours a day Adults (including older adults): 7-8 hours a day During puberty, teenagers' biological clocks shift, and they are more likely to go to bed later than younger children and adults, and they tend to want to sleep later in the morning. This delayed sleep-wake rhythm conflicts with the early-morning start times of many high schools and helps explain why most teenagers do not get enough sleep. Some people think that adults need less sleep as they age. But there is no evidence to show that older adults can get by with less sleep than people who are younger. As people age, however, they often get less sleep or they tend to spend less time in the deep, restful stage of sleep. Older adults are also more easily awakened. And it's not just the number of hours of sleep you get that matters. The quality of the sleep you get is also important. People whose sleep is frequently interrupted or cut short might not get enough of certain stages of sleep. If you are wondering whether you are getting enough sleep, including quality sleep, ask yourself: Do you have trouble getting up in the morning? Do you have trouble focusing during the day? Do you doze off during the day? If you answered yes to these three questions, you should work on improving your sleep. What are the health effects of not getting enough sleep? Sleep is important for overall health. When you don't get enough sleep (sleep deprivation), it does more than just make you feel tired.

But they involve mood swings known as mood episodes: The symptoms of a manic episode can include Feeling very up, high, or elated Feeling jumpy or wired, more active than usual Having a very short temper or seeming extremely irritable Having racing thoughts and talking very fast Needing less sleep Feeling like you are unusually important, talented, or powerful Do risky things that show poor judgment, such as eating and drinking too much, spending or giving away a lot of money, or having reckless sex The symptoms of a depressive episode can include Feeling very sad, hopeless, or worthless Feeling lonely or isolating yourself from others Talking very slowly, feeling like you have nothing to say, or forgetting a lot Having little energy Sleeping too much Eating too much or too little Lack of interest in your usual activities and being unable to do even simple things Thinking about death or suicide The symptoms of a mixed episode include both manic and depressive symptoms together. For example, you may feel very sad, empty, or hopeless, while at the same time feeling extremely energized. Some people with bipolar disorder may have milder symptoms. For example, you may have hypomania instead of mania. With hypomania, you may feel very good and find that you can get a lot done. You may not feel like anything is wrong. But your family and friends may notice your mood swings and changes in activity levels. They may realize that your behavior is unusual for you. After the hypomania, you might have severe depression. Your mood episodes may last a week or two or sometimes longer. During an episode, symptoms usually occur every day for most of the day. How is bipolar disorder diagnosed?

The main treatments for bipolar disorder include medicines, psychotherapy, or both: Medicines can help control the symptoms of bipolar disorder.

Psychotherapy (talk therapy) can help you recognize and change troubling emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. It can give you and your family support, education, skills, and coping strategies. There are several different types of psychotherapy that may help with bipolar disorder. Other treatment options include Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), a brain stimulation procedure that can help relieve symptoms. ECT is most often used for severe bipolar disorder that is not getting better with other treatments. It may also be used when someone needs a treatment that will work more quickly than medicines. This might be when a person has a high risk of suicide or is catatonic (unresponsive). Getting regular aerobic exercise may help with depression , anxiety , and trouble sleeping Keeping a life chart can help you and your provider track and treat your bipolar disorder. A life chart is a record of your daily mood symptoms, treatments, sleep patterns, and life events. Bipolar disorder is a lifelong illness.

Conversion disorder is a mental condition in which a person has blindness, paralysis, or other nervous system (neurologic) symptoms that cannot be explained by medical evaluation.Conversion disorder symptoms may occur because of a psychological conflict. Symptoms usually begin suddenly after a stressful experience. People are at risk of conversion disorder if they also have: A medical illness A dissociative disorder (escape from reality that is not on purpose) A personality disorder (inability to manage feelings and behaviors that are expected in certain social situations) People who have conversion disorder are not making up their symptoms in order to obtain shelter, for example (malingering). They are also not intentionally injuring themselves or lying about their symptoms just to become a patient (factitious disorder). Some health care providers falsely believe that conversion disorder is not a real condition and may tell people that the problem is all in their head. But this condition is real. It causes distress and cannot be turned on and off at will. The physical symptoms are thought to be an attempt to resolve the conflict the person feels inside. For example, a woman who believes it is not acceptable to have violent feelings may suddenly feel numbness in her arms after becoming so angry that she wanted to hit someone. Instead of allowing herself to have violent thoughts about hitting someone, she experiences the physical symptom of numbness in her arms.

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) uses an electric current to treat depression and some other mental illnesses.During ECT, the electric current triggers a seizure in the brain. Doctors believe that the seizure activity may help the brain "rewire" itself, which helps relieve symptoms. ECT is generally safe and effective. ECT is most often done in a hospital while you are asleep and pain free ( general anesthesia ): You receive medicine to relax you (muscle relaxant). You also receive another medicine (short-acting anesthetic) to put you briefly to sleep and prevent you from feeling pain. Electrodes are placed on your scalp. Two electrodes monitor your brain activity. Another two electrodes are used to deliver the electric current. When you are asleep, a small amount of electric current is delivered to your head to cause seizure activity in the brain. It lasts for about 40 seconds. You receive medicine to prevent the seizure from spreading throughout your body. As a result, your hands or feet move only slightly during the procedure. ECT is usually given once every 2 to 5 days for a total of 6 to 12 sessions. Sometimes more sessions are needed. Several minutes after the treatment, you wake up. You DO NOT remember the treatment. You are taken to a recovery area. There, the health care team monitors you closely. When you have recovered, you can go home. You need to have an adult drive you home. Be sure to arrange this ahead of time.

Illness anxiety disorder (IAD) is a preoccupation that physical symptoms are signs of a serious illness, even when there is no medical evidence to support the presence of an illness.People with IAD are overly focused on, and always thinking about, their physical health. They have an unrealistic fear of having or developing a serious disease. This disorder occurs equally in men and women. The way people with IAD think about their physical symptoms can make them more likely to have this condition. As they focus on and worry about physical sensations, a cycle of symptoms and worry begins, which can be hard to stop. It is important to realize that people with IAD do not purposely create these symptoms. They aren't able to control the symptoms. People who have a history of physical or sexual abuse are more likely to have IAD. But this doesn't mean that everyone with IAD has a history of abuse.

Munchausen syndrome by proxy is a mental illness and a form of child abuse . The caretaker of a child, most often a mother, either makes up fake symptoms or causes real symptoms to make it look like the child is sick.No one is sure what causes Munchausen syndrome by proxy. Sometimes, the person was abused as a child or has Munchausen syndrome (fake illness for themselves).

Somatic symptom disorder (SSD) occurs when a person feels extreme, exaggerated anxiety about physical symptoms. The person has such intense thoughts, feelings, and behaviors related to the symptoms, that they feel they cannot do some of the activities of daily life. They may believe routine medical problems are life threatening. This anxiety may not improve despite normal test results and reassurance from the health care provider. A person with SSD is not faking their symptoms. The pain and other problems are real. They may be caused by a medical problem. Often, no physical cause can be found. However, it is the extreme reaction and behaviors about the symptoms that are the main problem.SSD usually begins before age 30. It occurs more often in women than in men. It's not clear why some people develop this condition. Certain factors may be involved: Having a negative outlook Being more physically and emotionally sensitive to pain and other sensations Family history or upbringing Genetics People who have a history of physical or sexual abuse may be more likely to have this disorder. But not everyone with SSD has a history of abuse. SSD is similar to illness anxiety disorder (hypochondria). This is when people are overly anxious about becoming sick or developing a serious disease. They fully expect they will become very ill at some point. Unlike SSD, with illness anxiety disorder, there are few or no actual physical symptoms.





It's important to recognize and treat mental illnesses in children early on.  Once mental illness develops, it becomes a regular part of your child's behavior. This makes it more difficult to treat. But it's not always easy to know when your child has a serious problem. Everyday stresses can cause changes in your child's behavior. For example, getting a new brother or sister or going to a new school may cause a child to temporarily act out. Warning signs that it might be a more serious problem include: Problems in more than one setting (at school, at home, with peers) Changes in appetite or sleep Social withdrawal or fear of things he or she did not used to be not afraid of Returning to behaviors more common in younger children, such as bedwetting Signs of being upset, such as sadness or tearfulness Signs of self-destructive behavior, such as head-banging or suddenly getting hurt often Repeated thoughts of death To diagnose mental health problems, the doctor or mental health specialist looks at your child's signs and symptoms, medical history, and family history. Treatments include medicines and talk therapy. NIH: National Institute of Mental Health

Many people enjoy gambling, whether it's betting on a horse or playing poker on the Internet. Most people who gamble don't have a problem, but some lose control of their gambling. Signs of problem gambling include : Always thinking about gambling Lying about gambling Spending work or family time gambling Feeling bad after you gamble, but not quitting Gambling with money you need for other things If you have concerns about your gambling, ask for help. Your health care provider can work with you to find the treatment that's best for you. NIH: National Institutes of Health

What is delirium? Delirium is a mental state in which you are confused, disoriented, and not able to think or remember clearly. It usually starts suddenly. It is often temporary and treatable. There are three types of delirium: Hypoactive, where you are not active and seem sleepy, tired, or depressed Hyperactive, where you are restless or agitated Mixed, where you change back and forth between being hypoactive and hyperactive What causes delirium? There are many different problems that can cause delirium. Some of the more common causes include: Alcohol or drugs , either from intoxication or withdrawal. This includes a serious type of alcohol withdrawal syndrome called delirium tremens. It usually happens to people who stop drinking after years of alcohol abuse. Dehydration and electrolyte imbalances Dementia Hospitalization , especially in intensive care Infections , such as urinary tract infections , pneumonia , and the flu Medicines. This could be a side effect of a medicine, such as sedatives or opioids. Or it could be withdrawal after stopping a medicine. Metabolic disorders Organ failure , such as kidney or liver failure Poisoning Serious illnesses Severe pain Sleep deprivation Surgeries , including reactions to anesthesia Who is at risk for delirium? Certain factors put you at risk for delirium, including: Being in a hospital or nursing home Dementia Having a serious illness or more than one illness Having an infection Older age Surgery Taking medicines that affect the mind or behavior Taking high doses of pain medicines , such as opioids What are the symptoms of delirium? The symptoms of delirium usually start suddenly, over a few hours or a few days. They often come and go. The most common symptoms include: Changes in alertness (usually more alert in the morning, less at night) Changing levels of consciousness Confusion Disorganized thinking, talking in a way that doesn't make sense Disrupted sleep patterns, sleepiness Emotional changes: anger, agitation, depression , irritability, overexcitement Hallucinations and delusions Incontinence Memory problems, especially with short-term memory Trouble concentrating How is delirium diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis: A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms Physical and neurological exams Mental status testing Lab and diagnostic imaging tests Delirium and dementia have similar symptoms, so it can be hard to tell them apart. They can also occur together. Delirium starts suddenly and can cause hallucinations. The symptoms may get better or worse and can last for hours or weeks.  On the other hand, dementia develops slowly and does not cause hallucinations. The symptoms are stable and may last for months or years. What are the treatments for delirium? Treatment of delirium focuses on the causes and symptoms of delirium. The first step is to identify the cause. Often, treating the cause will lead to a full recovery. The recovery may take some time - weeks or sometimes even months. In the meantime, there may be treatments to manage the symptoms, such as: Controlling the environment, which includes making sure that the room is quiet and well-lit, having clocks or calendars in view, and having family members around Medicines, including those that control aggression or agitation and pain relievers if there is pain If needed, making sure that the person has a hearing aid, glasses, or other devices for communication Can delirium be prevented? Treating the conditions that can cause delirium may reduce the risk of getting it. Hospitals can help lower the risk of delirium by avoiding sedatives and making sure that the room is kept quiet, calm, and well-lit. It can also help to have family members around and to have the same staff members treat the person.























What is self-harm? Self-harm, or self-injury, is when a person hurts his or her own body on purpose. The injuries may be minor, but sometimes they can be severe. They may leave permanent scars or cause serious health problems. Some examples are: Cutting yourself (such as using a razor blade, knife, or other sharp object to cut your skin) Punching yourself or punching things (like a wall) Burning yourself with cigarettes, matches, or candles Pulling out your hair Poking objects through body openings Breaking your bones or bruising yourself Self-harm is not a mental disorder. It is a behavior - an unhealthy way to cope with strong feelings. However, some of the people who harm themselves do have a mental disorder . People who harm themselves are usually not trying to kill themselves .  But they are at higher risk of attempting suicide if they do not get help. Why do people harm themselves? There are different reasons why people harm themselves. Often, they have trouble coping and dealing with their feelings. They harm themselves to try to: Make themselves feel something, when they feel empty or numb inside Block upsetting memories Show that they need help Release strong feelings that overwhelm them, such as anger, loneliness, or hopelessness Punish themselves Feel a sense of control Who is at risk for self-harm? There are people of all ages who harm themselves, but it usually starts in the teen or early adult years. Self-harm is more common in people who: Were abused or went through a trauma as children Have mental disorders, such as Depression Eating disorders Post-traumatic stress disorder Certain personality disorders Misuse drugs or alcohol Have friends who self-harm Have low self-esteem What are the signs of self-harm? Signs that someone may be hurting themselves include: Having frequent cuts, bruises, or scars Wearing long sleeves or pants even in hot weather Making excuses about injuries Having sharp objects around for no clear reason How can I help someone who self-harms? If someone you know is self-harming, it is important not to be judgmental. Let that person know that you want to help. If the person is a child or teenager, ask him or her to talk to a trusted adult. If he or she won't do that, talk to a trusted adult yourself. If the person who is self-harming is an adult, suggest mental health counseling. What the treatments are for self-harm? There are no medicines to treat self-harming behaviors. But there are medicines to treat any mental disorders that the person may have, such as anxiety and depression. Treating the mental disorder may weaken the urge to self-harm. Mental health counseling or therapy can also help by teaching the person: Problem-solving skills New ways to cope with strong emotions Better relationship skills Ways to strengthen self-esteem If the problem is severe, the person may need more intensive treatment in a psychiatric hospital or a mental health day program.

What is suicide? Suicide is the taking of one's own life. It is a death that happens when someone harms themselves because they want to end their life. A suicide attempt is when someone harms themselves to try to end their life, but they do not die. Suicide is a major public health problem and a leading cause of death in the United States. The effects of suicide go beyond the person who acts to take his or her life. It can also have a lasting effect on family, friends, and communities. Who is at risk for suicide? Suicide does not discriminate. It can touch anyone, anywhere, at any time. But there are certain factors that can contribute to the risk of suicide, including: Having attempted suicide before Depression and other mental health disorders Alcohol or drug use disorder Family history of a mental health disorder Family history of an alcohol or drug use disorder Family history of suicide Family violence, including physical or sexual abuse Having guns in the home Being in or having recently gotten out of prison or jail Being exposed to others' suicidal behavior, such as a family member, peer, or celebrity Medical illness, including chronic pain Stressful life event, such as a job loss, financial problems, loss of a loved one, a breakup of a relationship, etc. Being between the ages of 15 and 24 years or over age 60 What are the warning signs for suicide? The warning signs for suicide include: Talking about wanting to die or wanting to kill oneself Making a plan or looking for a way to kill oneself, such as searching online Buying a gun or stockpiling pills Feeling empty, hopeless, trapped, or like there's no reason to live Being in unbearable pain Talking about being a burden to others Using more alcohol or drugs Acting anxious or agitated; behaving recklessly Sleeping too little or too much Withdrawing from family or friends or feeling isolated Showing rage or talking about seeking revenge Displaying extreme mood swings Saying good-bye to loved ones, putting affairs in order Some people may tell others about their suicidal thoughts. But others may try to hide them. This can make some of the signs harder to spot. What should I do if I need help or know someone who does? If you or someone you know has the warning signs for suicide, get help right away , especially if there is a change in behavior. If it is an emergency, dial 911. Otherwise there are five steps that you can take: Ask the person if they're thinking about killing themselves Keep them safe. Find out whether they have a plan for suicide and keep them away from things that they can use to kill themselves. Be there with them. Listen carefully and find out what they are thinking and feeling. Help them connect to resources that can help them, such as Calling the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255). Veterans can call and  press 1 to reach the Veterans Crisis Line. Texting the Crisis Text Line (text HOME to 741741) Texting the Veterans Crisis Line at 838255 Stay connected. Staying in touch after a crisis can make a difference. NIH: National Institute of Mental Health

Being a teenager is hard. You're under stress to be liked, do well in school, get along with your family, and make big decisions. You can't avoid most of these pressures, and worrying about them is normal. But feeling very sad, hopeless or worthless could be warning signs of a mental health problem.

You might need help if you have the signs mentioned above, or if you : Often feel very angry or very worried Feel grief for a long time after a loss or death Think your mind is controlled or out of control Use alcohol or drugs Exercise, diet and/or binge-eat obsessively Hurt other people or destroy property Do reckless things that could harm you or others Feel depressed (sad and hopeless) Mental health problems can be treated. To find help, talk to your parents, school counselor, or health care provider.





Your thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland in your neck, just above your collarbone.  It is one of your endocrine glands, which make hormones.  Thyroid hormones control the rate of many activities in your body. These include how fast you burn calories and how fast your heart beats. All of these activities are your body's metabolism. Thyroid problems include: Goiter - enlargement of the thyroid gland Hyperthyroidism - when your thyroid gland makes more thyroid hormones than your body needs Hypothyroidism - when your thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormones Thyroid cancer Thyroid nodules - lumps in the thyroid gland Thyroiditis - swelling of the thyroid To diagnose thyroid diseases, doctors use a medical history, physical exam, and thyroid tests . They sometimes also use a biopsy. Treatment depends on the problem, but may include medicines, radioiodine therapy, or thyroid surgery. Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health

What is hyperthyroidism? Hyperthyroidism, or overactive thyroid, happens when your thyroid gland makes more thyroid hormones than your body needs. Your thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck. It makes hormones that control the way the body uses energy. These hormones affect nearly every organ in your body and control many of your body's most important functions. For example, they affect your breathing, heart rate, weight, digestion, and moods. If not treated, hyperthyroidism can cause serious problems with your heart, bones, muscles, menstrual cycle, and fertility. But there are treatments that can help. What causes hyperthyroidism? Hyperthyroidism has several causes. They include: Grave's disease, an autoimmune disorder in which your immune system attacks your thyroid and causes it to make too much hormone. This is the most common cause. Thyroid nodules, which are growths on your thyroid. They are usually benign (not cancer). But they may become overactive and make too much thyroid hormone. Thyroid nodules are more common in older adults. Thyroiditis, inflammation of the thyroid. It causes stored thyroid hormone to leak out of your thyroid gland. Too much iodine. Iodine is found in some medicines, cough syrups, seaweed and seaweed-based supplements. Taking too much of them can cause your thyroid to make too much thyroid hormone. Too much thyroid medicine. This can happen if people who take thyroid hormone medicine for hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) take too much of it. Who is at risk for hyperthyroidism? You are at higher risk for hyperthyroidism if you: Are a woman Are older than age 60 Have been pregnant or had a baby within the past 6 months Have had thyroid surgery or a thyroid problem, such as goiter Have a family history of thyroid disease Have pernicious anemia , in which the body cannot make enough healthy red blood cells because it does not have enough vitamin B12 Have type 1 diabetes or primary adrenal insufficiency, a hormonal disorder Get too much iodine, from eating large amounts of foods containing iodine or using iodine-containing medicines or supplements What are the symptoms of hyperthyroidism? The symptoms of hyperthyroidism can vary from person to person and may include: Nervousness or irritability Fatigue Muscle weakness Trouble tolerating heat Trouble sleeping Tremor , usually in your hands Rapid and irregular heartbeat Frequent bowel movements or diarrhea Weight loss Mood swings Goiter, an enlarged thyroid that may cause your neck to look swollen. Sometimes it can cause trouble with breathing or swallowing. Adults over age 60 may have different symptoms than younger adults. For example, they may lose their appetite or withdraw from other people. Sometimes this can be mistaken for depression or dementia . What other problems can hyperthyroidism cause? If hyperthyroidism isn't treated, it can cause some serious health problems, including: An irregular heartbeat that can lead to blood clots , stroke , heart failure , and other heart problems An eye disease called Graves' ophthalmopathy. It can cause double vision, light sensitivity, and eye pain. In rare cases, it can lead to vision loss . Thinning bones and osteoporosis Fertility problems in women Complications in pregnancy, such as premature birth , low birth weight , high blood pressure in pregnancy , and miscarriage How is hyperthyroidism diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis: A medical history, including asking about symptoms A physical exam Thyroid tests , such as TSH , T3 , T4 , and thyroid antibody  blood tests Imaging tests , such as a thyroid scan, ultrasound , or radioactive iodine uptake test.  A radioactive iodine uptake test measures how much radioactive iodine your thyroid takes up from your blood after you swallow a small amount of it. What are the treatments for hyperthyroidism? The treatments for hyperthyroidism include medicines, radioiodine therapy, and thyroid surgery: Medicines for hyperthyroidism include Antithyroid medicines, which cause your thyroid to make less thyroid hormone. You probably need to take the medicines for 1 to 2 years. In some cases, you might need to take the medicines for several years. This is the simplest treatment, but it is often not a permanent cure. Beta blocker medicines, which can reduce symptoms such as tremors, rapid heartbeat, and nervousness. They work quickly and can help you feel better until other treatments take effect. Radioiodine therapy is a common and effective treatment for hyperthyroidism. It involves taking radioactive iodine by mouth as a capsule or liquid. This slowly destroys the cells of the thyroid gland that produce thyroid hormone. It does not affect other body tissues. Almost everyone who has radioactive iodine treatment later develops hypothyroidism. This is because the thyroid hormone-producing cells have been destroyed. But hypothyroidism is easier to treat and causes fewer long-term health problems than hyperthyroidism. Surgery to remove part or most of the thyroid gland is done in rare cases. It might be an option for people with large goiters or pregnant women who cannot take antithyroid medicines. If you have all of your thyroid removed, you will need to take thyroid medicines for the rest of your life. Some people who have part of their thyroid removed also need to take medicines. If you have hyperthyroidism, it's important not to get too much iodine. Talk to your health care provider about which foods, supplements, and medicines you need to avoid. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases

What is hypothyroidism? Hypothyroidism, or underactive thyroid, happens when your thyroid gland doesn't make enough thyroid hormones to meet your body's needs. Your thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck. It makes hormones that control the way the body uses energy. These hormones affect nearly every organ in your body and control many of your body's most important functions. For example, they affect your breathing, heart rate, weight, digestion, and moods. Without enough thyroid hormones, many of your body's functions slow down. But there are treatments that can help. What causes hypothyroidism? Hypothyroidism has several causes. They include: Hashimoto's disease, an autoimmune disorder where your immune system attacks your thyroid. This is the most common cause. Thyroiditis, inflammation of the thyroid Congenital hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism that is present at birth Surgical removal of part or all of the thyroid Radiation treatment of the thyroid Certain medicines In rare cases, a pituitary disease or too much or too little iodine in your diet Who is at risk for hypothyroidism? You are at higher risk for hypothyroidism if you: Are a woman Are older than age 60 Have had a thyroid problem before, such as a goiter Have had surgery to correct a thyroid problem Have received radiation treatment to the thyroid, neck, or chest Have a family history of thyroid disease Were pregnant or had a baby in the past 6 months Have Turner syndrome , a genetic disorder that affects females Have pernicious anemia , in which the body cannot make enough healthy red blood cells because it does not have enough vitamin B12 Have Sjogren's syndrome , a disease that causes dry eyes and mouth Have type 1 diabetes Have rheumatoid arthritis , an autoimmune disease that affects the joints Have lupus , a chronic autoimmune disease What are the symptoms of hypothyroidism? The symptoms of hypothyroidism can vary from person to person and may include: Fatigue Weight gain A puffy face Trouble tolerating cold Joint and muscle pain Constipation Dry skin Dry, thinning hair Decreased sweating Heavy or irregular menstrual periods Fertility problems in women Depression Slowed heart rate Goiter, an enlarged thyroid that may cause your neck to look swollen. Sometimes it can cause trouble with breathing or swallowing. Because hypothyroidism develops slowly, many people don't notice symptoms of the disease for months or even years. What other problems can hypothyroidism cause? Hypothyroidism can contribute to high cholesterol . In rare cases, untreated hypothyroidism can cause myxedema coma. This is a condition in which your body's functions slow down to the point that it becomes life-threatening. During pregnancy, hypothyroidism can cause complications , such as premature birth , high blood pressure in pregnancy , and miscarriage . It can also slow the baby's growth and development . How is hypothyroidism diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis: A medical history, including asking about your symptoms A physical exam Thyroid tests , such as TSH , T3 , T4 , and thyroid antibody  blood tests Imaging tests , such as a thyroid scan, ultrasound , or radioactive iodine uptake test. A radioactive iodine uptake test measures how much radioactive iodine your thyroid takes up from your blood after you swallow a small amount of it. What are the treatments for hypothyroidism? The treatment for hypothyroidism is medicine to replace the hormone that your own thyroid can no longer make. About 6 to 8 weeks after you start taking the medicine, you will get a blood test to check your thyroid hormone level. Your health care provider will adjust your dose if needed. Each time your dose is adjusted, you'll have another blood test. Once you find the right dose, you will probably get a blood test in 6 months. After that, you will need the test once a year. If you take your medicine according to the instructions, you usually should be able to control the hypothyroidism. You should never stop taking your medicine without talking with your health care provider first. If you have Hashimoto's disease or other types of autoimmune thyroid disorders, you may be sensitive to harmful side effects from iodine. Talk to your health care provider about which foods, supplements, and medicines you need to avoid. Women need more iodine when they are pregnant because the baby gets iodine from the mother's diet. If you are pregnant, talk with your health care provider about how much iodine you need. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases

Your thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland in your neck, just above your collarbone.  It makes hormones that help the body work normally. There are several types of cancer of the thyroid gland. You are at greater risk if you: Are between ages 25 and 65 Are a woman Are Asian Have a family member who has had thyroid disease Have had radiation treatments to your head or neck You should see a doctor if you have a lump or swelling in your neck. Doctors use a physical exam, thyroid tests , other blood and imaging tests, and a biopsy to diagnose thyroid cancer. Treatment depends on the type of cancer you have and how far the cancer has spread. Many patients receive a combination of treatments. They may include surgery, radioactive iodine, hormone treatment, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells. NIH: National Cancer Institute

Your thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland in your neck, just above your collarbone. It is one of your endocrine glands, which make hormones. Thyroid hormones control the rate of many activities in your body. They include how fast you burn calories and how fast your heart beats. Thyroid tests check how well your thyroid is working. They are also used to diagnose and help find the cause of thyroid diseases such as hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism . Thyroid tests include blood tests and imaging tests. Blood tests for your thyroid include: TSH - measures thyroid-stimulating hormone. It is the most accurate measure of thyroid activity. T3 and T4 - measure different thyroid hormones. TSI - measures thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin. Antithyroid antibody test - measures antibodies (markers in the blood). Imaging tests include CT scans, ultrasound, and nuclear medicine tests. One type of nuclear medicine test is the thyroid scan. It uses small amounts of radioactive material to create a picture of the thyroid, showing its size, shape, and position. It can help find the cause of hyperthyroidism and check for thyroid nodules (lumps in the thyroid). Another nuclear test is the radioactive iodine uptake test, or thyroid uptake test. It checks how well your thyroid is working and can help find the cause of hyperthyroidism. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases



The ACE test measures the level of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the blood.A blood sample is needed .

Antithyroglobulin antibody is a test to measure antibodies to a protein called thyroglobulin. This protein is found in thyroid cells.A blood sample is needed.

Microsomes are found inside thyroid cells. The body produces antibodies to microsomes when there has been damage to thyroid cells. The antithyroid microsomal antibody test measures these antibodies in the blood.A blood sample is needed.

Bulging eyes is the abnormal protrusion (bulging out) of one or both eyeballs.Prominent eyes may be a family trait. But prominent eyes are not the same as bulging eyes. Bulging eyes should be checked by a health care provider. Bulging of one eye, especially in a child, can be a very serious sign. It should be checked right away. Hyperthyroidism (particularly Graves disease ) is the most common medical cause of bulging eyes. With this condition, the eyes do not blink often and seem to have a staring quality. Normally, there should be no visible white between the top of the iris (the colored part of the eye) and the upper eyelid. Seeing white in this area most often is a sign that the eye is bulging. Because eye changes most often develop slowly, family members may not notice it until the condition is fairly advanced. Photos often draw attention to the bulging when it may have gone unnoticed before.

Fine needle aspiration of the thyroid gland is a procedure to remove thyroid cells for examination. The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped gland located inside the front of the lower neck.This test may be done in the health care provider's office or in a hospital. Numbing medicine (anesthesia) may or may not be used. Because the needle is very thin, you may not need this medicine. You lie on your back with a pillow under your shoulders with your neck extended. The biopsy site is cleaned. A thin needle is inserted into your thyroid, where it collects a sample of thyroid cells and fluid. The needle is then taken out. If the provider cannot feel the biopsy site, they may use ultrasound or a CT scan to guide where to put the needle. Ultrasound and CT scans are painless procedures that show images inside the body. Pressure is applied to the biopsy site to stop any bleeding. The site is then covered with a bandage.

A simple goiter is an enlargement of the thyroid gland. It is usually not a tumor or cancer.The thyroid gland is an important organ of the endocrine system . It is located at the front of the neck just above where your collarbones meet. The gland makes the hormones that control the way every cell in the body uses energy. This process is called metabolism . Iodine deficiency is the most common cause of goiter. The body needs iodine to produce thyroid hormone. If you do not have enough iodine in your diet, the thyroid gets larger to try and capture all the iodine it can, so it can make the right amount of thyroid hormone. So, a goiter can be a sign the thyroid is not able to make enough thyroid hormone. The use of iodized salt in the United States prevents a lack of iodine in the diet. Other causes of goiter include: The body's immune system attacking the thyroid gland ( autoimmune problem ) Certain medicines (lithium, amiodarone) Infections (rare) Cigarette smoking Eating very large amounts of certain foods (soy, peanuts, or vegetables in the broccoli and cabbage family) Toxic nodular goiter, an enlarged thyroid gland that has a small growth or many growths called nodules, which produce too much thyroid hormone Simple goiters are more common in: People over age 40 People with a family history of goiter People who are born and raised in areas with iodine deficiency Women

Radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) tests thyroid function. It measures how much radioactive iodine is taken up by your thyroid gland in a certain time period. A similar test is the thyroid scan . The 2 tests are commonly performed together, but they can be done separately.The test is done in this way: You are given a pill that contains a tiny amount of radioactive iodine. After swallowing it, you wait as the iodine collects in the thyroid. The first uptake is usually done 4 to 6 hours after you take the iodine pill. Another uptake is usually done 24 hours later. During the uptake, you lie on your back on a table. A device called a gamma probe is moved back and forth over the area of your neck where the thyroid gland is located. The probe detects the location and intensity of the rays given off by the radioactive material. A computer displays how much of the tracer is taken up by the thyroid gland. The test takes less than 30 minutes.

The thyroid gland is normally located at the front of the neck. A retrosternal thyroid refers to the abnormal location of all or part of the thyroid gland below the breastbone (sternum).A retrosternal goiter is always a consideration in people who have a mass sticking out of the neck. A retrosternal goiter often causes no symptoms for years. It is often detected when a chest x-ray or CT scan is done for another reason. Any symptoms are usually due to pressure on nearby structures, such as the windpipe (trachea) and swallowing tube (esophagus). Surgery to completely remove the goiter may be recommended, even if you do not have symptoms. During the surgery: You receive general anesthesia. This makes you asleep and unable to feel pain. You lie on your back with your neck slightly extended. The surgeon makes a cut (incision) in the front of your lower neck just above the collar bones to determine if the mass can be removed without opening the chest. Most of the time, the surgery can be done this way. If the mass is deep inside the chest, the surgeon makes an incision along the middle of your chest bone. The entire goiter is then removed. A tube may be left in place to drain fluid and blood. It is usually removed in 1 to 2 days. The incisions are closed with stitches (sutures).

Silent thyroiditis is an immune reaction of the thyroid gland. The disorder can cause hyperthyroidism, followed by hypothyroidism. The thyroid gland is located in the neck, just above where your collarbones meet in the middle.The cause of the disease is unknown. But it is related to an attack against the thyroid by the immune system . The disease affects women more often than men. The disease can occur in women who have just had a baby. It can also be caused by medicines such as interferon and amiodarone, and some types of chemotherapy, which affect the immune system.

Subacute thyroiditis is an immune reaction of the thyroid gland that often follows an upper respiratory infection. The thyroid gland is located in the neck, just above where your collarbones meet in the middle.Subacute thyroiditis is an uncommon condition. It is thought to be the result of a viral infection. The condition often occurs a few weeks after a viral infection of the ear, sinus, or throat, such as mumps, the flu, or a common cold. Subacute thyroiditis occurs most often in middle-aged women with symptoms of a viral upper respiratory tract infection in the past month.

Triiodothyronine (T3) is a thyroid hormone. It plays an important role in the body's control of metabolism (the many processes that control the rate of activity in cells and tissues). A laboratory test can be done to measure the amount of T3 in your blood.A blood sample is needed.

The T3RU test measures the level of proteins that carry thyroid hormone in the blood. This can help your health care provider interpret the results of T3 and T4 blood tests. Because tests called the free T4 blood test and thyroxine binding globulin (TBG) blood tests are now available, the T3RU test is rarely used these days.A blood sample is needed.

T4 (thyroxine) is the main hormone produced by the thyroid gland. A laboratory test can be done to measure the amount of free T4 in your blood. Free T4 is the thyroxine that is not attached to a protein in the blood.A blood sample is needed.

The TBG blood test measures the level of a protein that moves thyroid hormone throughout your body. This protein is called thyroxine binding globulin (TBG).A blood sample is taken and then sent to a laboratory for testing.

Thyroid gland removal is surgery to remove all or part of the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped gland located inside the front of the lower neck. The thyroid gland is part of the hormone ( endocrine ) system. It helps your body regulate your metabolism .Depending on the reason you are having your thyroid gland removed, the type of thyroidectomy you have will be either a: Total thyroidectomy, which removes the entire gland Subtotal or partial thyroidectomy, which removes part of the thyroid gland You will have general anesthesia (asleep and pain-free) for this surgery. In rare cases, the surgery is done with local anesthesia and medicine to relax you. You will be awake, but pain-free. During the surgery: The surgeon makes a horizontal cut in the front of your lower neck just above the collar bones. All or part of the gland is removed through the cut. The surgeon is careful not to damage the blood vessels and nerves in your neck. A small tube (catheter) may be placed into the area to help drain blood and other fluids that build up. The drain will be removed in 1 or 2 days. The cuts are closed with sutures (stitches). Surgery to remove your whole thyroid may take up to 4 hours. It may take less time if only part of the thyroid is removed. Newer techniques that require a smaller incision near the thyroid or at other locations and which involve the use of endoscopy have been developed.

You had surgery to remove part or all of your thyroid gland. This operation is called thyroidectomy . Now that you're going home, follow the surgeon's instructions on how to care for yourself while you heal.Depending on the reason for the surgery, either all or part of your thyroid was removed. You probably spent 1 to 3 days in the hospital.

A thyroid nodule is a growth (lump) in the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland is located at the front of the neck, just above where your collarbones meet in the middle.Thyroid nodules are caused by an overgrowth of cells in the thyroid gland. These growths can be: Not cancer (benign), thyroid cancer (malignant), or very rarely, other cancers or infections Fluid-filled (cysts) One nodule or a group of small nodules Producing thyroid hormones (hot nodule) or not making thyroid hormones (cold nodule) Thyroid nodules are very common. They occur more often in women than in men. A person's chance of getting a thyroid nodule increases with age. Only a few thyroid nodules are due to thyroid cancer . A thyroid nodule is more likely to be cancer if you: Have a hard nodule Have a nodule that is stuck to nearby structures Have a family history of thyroid cancer Have noticed a change in your voice Are younger than 20 or older than 70 Have a history of radiation exposure to the head or neck Are male Causes of thyroid nodules are not always found, but can include: Hashimoto's disease (a reaction of the immune system against the thyroid gland) Lack of iodine in the diet

A thyroid scan uses a radioactive iodine tracer to examine the structure and function of the thyroid gland. This test is often done together with a radioactive iodine uptake test .The test is done in this way: You are given a pill that contains a tiny amount of radioactive iodine. After swallowing it, you wait as the iodine collects in your thyroid. The first scan is usually done 4 to 6 hours after you take the iodine pill. Another scan is usually done 24 hours later. During the scan, you lie on your back on a movable table. Your neck and chest are positioned under the scanner. You must lie still so that the scanner gets a clear image. The scanner detects the location and intensity of the rays given off by the radioactive material. A computer displays images of the thyroid gland. Other scans use a substance called technetium instead of radioactive iodine.

Thyroid storm is a very rare, but life-threatening condition of the thyroid gland that develops in cases of untreated thyrotoxicosis ( hyperthyroidism , or overactive thyroid). The thyroid gland is located in the neck, just above where your collarbones meet in the middle.Thyroid storm occurs due to a major stress such as trauma, heart attack , or infection in people with uncontrolled hyperthyroidism. In rare cases, thyroid storm can be caused by treatment of hyperthyroidism with radioactive iodine therapy for Graves disease . This can occur even a week or more after the radioactive iodine treatment.



Toxic nodular goiter involves an enlarged thyroid gland. The gland contains areas that have increased in size and formed nodules. One or more of these nodules produce too much thyroid hormone.Toxic nodular goiter starts from an existing simple goiter . It occurs most often in older adults. Risk factors include being female and over 55 years old. This disorder is rare in children. Most people who develop it have had a goiter with nodules for many years. Sometimes the thyroid gland is only slightly enlarged, and the goiter was not already diagnosed. Sometimes, people with toxic multinodular goiter will develop high thyroid levels for the first time. This mostly occurs after they take in a large amount of iodine through a vein (intravenously) or by mouth. The iodine may be used as contrast for a CT scan or heart catheterization . Taking medicines that contain iodine, such as amiodarone, may also lead to the disorder. Moving from a country with iodine deficiency to a country with a lot of iodine in the diet can also turn a simple goiter into a toxic goiter.

A TSH test measures the amount of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in your blood. TSH is produced by the pituitary gland. It prompts the thyroid gland to make and release thyroid hormones into the blood.A blood sample is needed. Other thyroid tests that may be done at the same time include: T3 test (free or total) T4 test (free or total)

TSI stands for thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin. TSIs are antibodies that tell the thyroid gland to become more active and release excess amounts of thyroid hormone into the blood. A TSI test measures the amount of thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin in your blood.A blood sample is needed.















An arrhythmia is a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat. It means that your heart beats too quickly, too slowly, or with an irregular pattern. When the heart beats faster than normal, it is called tachycardia. When the heart beats too slowly, it is called bradycardia. The most common type of arrhythmia is atrial fibrillation , which causes an irregular and fast heart beat. Many factors can affect your heart's rhythm, such as having had a heart attack , smoking, congenital heart defects , and stress. Some substances or medicines may also cause arrhythmias. Symptoms of arrhythmias include: Fast or slow heart beat Skipping beats Lightheadedness or dizziness Chest pain Shortness of breath Sweating Your doctor can run tests to find out if you have an arrhythmia. Treatment to restore a normal heart rhythm may include medicines, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) or pacemaker , or sometimes surgery. NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute

An arrhythmia is a problem with the speed or rhythm of the heartbeat.  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common type of arrhythmia . The cause is a disorder in the heart's electrical system. Often, people who have AF may not even feel symptoms. But you may feel
: Palpitations -- an abnormal rapid heartbeat Shortness of breath Weakness or difficulty exercising Chest pain Dizziness or fainting Fatigue Confusion AF can lead to an increased risk of stroke . In many patients, it can also cause chest pain, heart attack , or heart failure . Doctors diagnose AF using family and medical history, a physical exam, and a test called an electrocardiogram (EKG), which looks at the electrical waves your heart makes. Treatments include medicines and procedures to restore normal rhythm. NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute

Each year almost 800,000 Americans have a heart attack. A heart attack happens when blood flow to the heart suddenly becomes blocked. Without the blood coming in, the heart can't get oxygen. If not treated quickly, the heart muscle begins to die. But if you do get quick treatment, you may be able to prevent or limit damage to the heart muscle. That's why it's important to know the symptoms of a heart attack and call 911 if you or someone else is having them. You should call, even if you are not sure that it is a heart attack. The most common symptoms in men and women are: Chest discomfort. It is often in center or left side of the chest. It usually lasts more than a few minutes. It may go away and come back. It can feel like pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain . It also can feel like heartburn or indigestion. Shortness of breath. Sometimes this is your only symptom. You may get it before or during the chest discomfort. It can happen when you are resting or doing a little bit of physical activity. Discomfort in the upper body. You may feel pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, shoulders, neck, jaw, or upper part of the stomach. You may also have other symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and lightheadedness. You may break out in a cold sweat. Sometimes women will have different symptoms then men. For example, they are more likely to feel tired for no reason. The most common cause of heart attacks is coronary artery disease (CAD). With CAD, there is a buildup of cholesterol and other material, called plaque, on their inner walls or the arteries. This is atherosclerosis . It can build up for years. Eventually an area of plaque can rupture (break open). A blood clot can form around the plaque and block the artery. A less common cause of heart attack is a severe spasm (tightening) of a coronary artery. The spasm cuts off blood flow through the artery. At the hospital, health care providers make a diagnosis based on your symptoms, blood tests, and different heart health tests . Treatments may include medicines and medical procedures such as coronary angioplasty . After a heart attack, cardiac rehabilitation and lifestyle changes can help you recover. NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute

A congenital heart defect is a problem with the structure of the heart. It is present at birth. Congenital heart defects are the most common type of birth defect. The defects can involve the walls of the heart, the valves of the heart, and the arteries and veins near the heart. They can disrupt the normal flow of blood through the heart. The blood flow can slow down, go in the wrong direction or to the wrong place, or be blocked completely. Doctors use a physical exam and special heart tests to diagnose congenital heart defects. They often find severe defects during pregnancy or soon after birth. Signs and symptoms of severe defects in newborns include: Rapid breathing Cyanosis - a bluish tint to the skin, lips, and fingernails Fatigue Poor blood circulation Many congenital heart defects cause few or no signs and symptoms. They are often not diagnosed until children are older. Many children with congenital heart defects don't need treatment, but others do. Treatment can include medicines, catheter procedures, surgery, and heart transplants. The treatment depends on the type of the defect, how severe it is, and a child's age, size, and general health. NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute

An arrhythmia is any disorder of your heart rate or rhythm. It means that your heart beats too quickly, too slowly, or with an irregular pattern. Most arrhythmias result from problems in the electrical system of the heart. If your arrhythmia is serious, you may need a cardiac pacemaker or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD).  They are devices that are implanted in your chest or abdomen. A pacemaker helps control abnormal heart rhythms. It uses electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate. It can speed up a slow heart rhythm, control a fast heart rhythm, and coordinate the chambers of the heart. An ICD monitors heart rhythms. If it senses dangerous rhythms, it delivers shocks. This treatment is called defibrillation. An ICD can help control life-threatening arrhythmias, especially those that can cause sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). Most new ICDs can act as both a pacemaker and a defibrillator. Many ICDs also record the heart's electrical patterns when there is an abnormal heartbeat. This can help the doctor plan future treatment. Getting a pacemaker or ICD requires minor surgery. You usually need to stay in the hospital for a day or two, so your doctor can make sure that the device is working well. You will probably be back to your normal activities within a few days.





An arrhythmia is a disorder of the heart rate (pulse) or heart rhythm. The heart can beat too fast (tachycardia), too slow (bradycardia), or irregularly. An arrhythmia can be harmless, a sign of other heart problems, or an immediate danger to your health.Normally, your heart works as a pump that brings blood to the lungs and the rest of the body. To help this happen, your heart has an electrical system that makes sure it contracts (squeezes) in an orderly way. The electrical impulse that signals your heart to contract begins in an area of the heart called the sinoatrial node (also called the sinus node or SA node). This is your heart’s natural pacemaker. The signal leaves the SA node and travels through the heart along a set electrical pathway. Different nerve messages signal your heart to beat slower or faster. Arrhythmias are caused by problems with the heart's electrical conduction system. Abnormal (extra) signals may occur. Electrical signals may be blocked or slowed. Electrical signals travel in new or different pathways through the heart. Some common causes of abnormal heartbeats are: Abnormal levels of potassium or other substances in the body Heart attack, or a damaged heart muscle from a past heart attack Heart disease that is present at birth (congenital) Heart failure or an enlarged heart Overactive thyroid gland Watch this video about: Arrhythmias Arrhythmias may also be caused by some substances or drugs, including: Alcohol or stimulant drugs Certain medicines Cigarette smoking (nicotine) Some of the more common abnormal heart rhythms are: Atrial fibrillation or flutter Atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT) Heart block or atrioventricular block Multifocal atrial tachycardia Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia Sick sinus syndrome Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome

Atrial fibrillation or flutter is a common type of abnormal heartbeat. The heart rhythm is fast and most often irregular.When working well, the 4 chambers of the heart contract (squeeze) in an organized way. Electrical signals direct your heart to pump the right amount of blood for your body's needs. The signals begin in an area called the sinoatrial node (also called the sinus node or SA node). In atrial fibrillation, the electrical impulse of the heart is not regular. This is because the sinoatrial node no longer controls the heart rhythm. Parts of the heart cannot contract in an organized pattern. As a result, the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. In atrial flutter, the ventricles (lower heart chambers) may beat very rapidly, but in a regular pattern. These problems can affect both men and women. They become more common with increasing age. Common causes of atrial fibrillation include: Alcohol use (especially binge drinking) Coronary artery disease Heart attack or heart bypass surgery Heart failure or an enlarged heart Heart valve disease (most often the mitral valve) Hypertension Medicines Overactive thyroid gland ( hyperthyroidism ) Pericarditis Sick sinus syndrome

Cardiac ablation is a procedure that is used to scar small areas in your heart that may be involved in your heart rhythm problems . This can prevent the abnormal electrical signals or rhythms from moving through the heart. During the procedure, small wires called electrodes are placed inside your heart to measure your heart's electrical activity. When the source of the problem is found, the tissue causing the problem is destroyed.There are two methods for performing cardiac ablation: Radiofrequency ablation uses heat energy to eliminate the problem area. Cryoablation uses very cold temperatures. The type of procedure you have will depend on what kind of abnormal heart rhythm you have. Cardiac ablation procedures are done in a hospital laboratory by trained staff. This includes cardiologists (heart doctors), technicians, and nurses. The setting is safe and controlled so your risk is as low as possible. You will be given medicine (a sedative) before the procedure to help you relax. The skin on your neck, arm, or groin will be cleaned well and made numb with an anesthetic. Next, the doctor will make a small cut in the skin. A small, flexible tube (catheter) will be inserted through this cut into one of the blood vessels in the area. The doctor will use live x-ray images to carefully guide the catheter up into your heart. Sometimes more than one catheter is needed. Once the catheter is in place, your doctor will place small electrodes in different areas of your heart. These electrodes are connected to monitors that allow the cardiologist to tell what area in your heart is causing problems with your heart rhythm. In most cases, there are one or more specific areas. Once the source of the problem has been found, one of the catheter lines is used to send electrical (or sometimes cold) energy to the problem area. This creates a small scar that causes the heart rhythm problem to stop. Catheter ablation is a long procedure. It can last 4 or more hours. During the procedure your heart will be monitored closely. A health care provider may ask you if you are having symptoms at different times during the procedure. Symptoms you may feel are: A brief burning when medicines are injected A faster or stronger heartbeat Lightheadedness Burning when the electrical energy is used



A cardiac event monitor is a device that you control to record the electrical activity of your heart (ECG). This device is about the size of a pager. It records your heart rate and rhythm. Cardiac event monitors are used when you need long-term monitoring of symptoms that occur less than daily.Each type of monitor is slightly different, but they all have sensors (called electrodes) to record your ECG. In some models, these attach to the skin on your chest using sticky patches. The sensors need good contact with your skin. Poor contact can cause poor results. You should keep your skin free from oils, creams, and sweat (as much as possible). The technician who places the monitor will perform the following to get a good ECG recording: Men will have the area on their chest shaved where the electrode patches will be placed. The area of skin where the electrodes will be attached will be cleaned with alcohol before the sensors are attached. You can carry or wear a cardiac event monitor up to 30 days. You carry the device in your hand, wear on your wrist, or keep it in your pocket. Event monitors can be worn for weeks or until symptoms occur. There are several types of cardiac event monitors. Loop memory monitor. The electrodes remain attached to your chest, and the monitor constantly records, but does not save, your ECG. When you feel symptoms, you press a button to activate the device. The device will then save the ECG from shortly before, during, and for a time after your symptoms begin. Some event monitors start on their own if they detect abnormal heart rhythms. Symptom event monitor. This device records your ECG only when symptoms occur, not before they occur. You carry this device in a pocket or wear it on your wrist. When you feel symptoms, you turn on the device and place the electrodes on your chest to record the ECG. Patch recorders. This monitor does not use wires or electrodes. It continuously monitors ECG activity for 14 days using an adhesive patch that sticks to the chest. Implanted loop recorders. This is a small monitor that is implanted under the skin on the chest. It can be left in place to monitor heart rhythms for 3 or more years. While wearing the device: You should continue your normal activities while wearing the monitor. You may be asked to exercise or adjust your activity level during the test. Keep a diary of what activities you do while wearing the monitor, how you feel, and any symptoms you have. This will help your health care provider match symptoms with your monitor findings. The monitoring station staff will tell you how to transfer data over the telephone. Your provider will look at the data and see if there have been any abnormal heart rhythms. The monitoring company or the provider who ordered the monitor may contact you if a concerning rhythm is discovered. While wearing the device, you may be asked to avoid certain things that can disrupt the signal between the sensors and the monitor. These may include: Cell phones Electric blankets Electric toothbrushes High-voltage areas Magnets Metal detectors Ask the technician who attaches the device for a list of things to avoid.

Cardioversion is a method to bring an abnormal heart rhythm back to normal.Cardioversion can be done using an electric shock or with drugs. ELECTRICAL CARDIOVERSION Electrical cardioversion is done with a device that gives off an electrical shock to the heart to change the rhythm back to normal. The device is called a defibrillator. The shock can be delivered from a device outside the body called an external defibrillator. These are found in emergency rooms, ambulances, or some public places such as airports. Electrode patches are placed on the chest and back. The patches are connected to the defibrillator. Or, paddles attached to the devices are placed directly onto the chest. The defibrillator is activated and an electric shock is delivered to your heart. This shock briefly stops all electrical activity of the heart. Then it allows the normal heart rhythm to return. Sometimes more than one shock, or a shock with higher energy is needed. An external defibrillator is used to treat abnormal heart rhythms ( arrhythmia ) that cause collapse and cardiac arrest. Examples are ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. These same devices may also be used to treat less dangerous abnormal rhythms, problems such as atrial fibrillation. Some people may need to start blood thinners beforehand to prevent small blood clots. You will be given medicine to help you relax before the procedure. After the procedure, you may be given medicines to prevent blood clots or to help prevent the arrhythmia from coming back. An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is a device that is placed inside your body. It is most often used in people who are at risk for sudden death because their heart function is so poor, or they have had dangerous heart rhythms before. The ICD is implanted underneath the skin of your upper chest or abdomen. Wires are attached that go into or near the heart. If the device detects a dangerous heartbeat, it sends an electrical shock to the heart to change the rhythm back to normal. CARDIOVERSION USING DRUGS Cardioversion can be done using drugs that are taken by mouth or given through an intravenous line (IV). It can take from several minutes to days for this treatment to work. This treatment is often done while in a hospital where your heart rhythm will be monitored. Cardioversion using drugs can be done outside the hospital. This treatment is most often used for people with atrial fibrillation that comes and goes. However, you will need to be closely followed-up by a cardiologist. You may be given blood thinning medicines to prevent blood clots from forming and leaving the heart (which can cause a stroke). COMPLICATIONS Complications of cardioversion are uncommon, but may include: Allergic reactions from medicines used Blood clots that can cause a stroke or other organ damage Bruising, burning, or pain where the electrodes were used Worsening of the arrhythmia People who perform external cardioversion may be shocked if the procedure is not done correctly. This can cause heart rhythm problems, pain, and even death.

Digitalis is a medicine that is used to treat certain heart conditions. Digitalis toxicity can be a side effect of digitalis therapy. It may occur when you take too much of the drug at one time. It can also occur when levels of the drug build up for other reasons such as other medical problems you have. The most common prescription form of this medicine is called digoxin. Digitoxin is another form of digitalis.Digitalis toxicity can be caused by high levels of digitalis in the body. A lower tolerance to the drug can also cause digitalis toxicity. People with lower tolerance may have a normal level of digitalis in their blood. They may develop digitalis toxicity if they have other risk factors. People with heart failure who take digoxin are commonly given medicines called diuretics. This drugs remove excess fluid from the body. Many diuretics can cause potassium loss. A low level of potassium in the body can increase the risk of digitalis toxicity. Digitalis toxicity may also develop in people who take digoxin and have a low level of magnesium in their body. You are more likely to have this condition if you take digoxin, digitoxin, or other digitalis medicines along with drugs that interact with it. Some of these drugs are quinidine, flecainide, verapamil, and amiodarone. If your kidneys do not work well, digitalis can build up in your body. Normally, it is removed through the urine. Any problem that affects how your kidneys work (including dehydration ) makes digitalis toxicity more likely. Some plants contain chemicals that can cause symptoms similar to digitalis toxicity if they are eaten. These include foxglove, oleander, and lily of the valley.

Ectopic heartbeats are changes in a heartbeat that is otherwise normal. These changes lead to extra or skipped heartbeats. There is often not a clear cause for these changes. They are common. The two most common types of ectopic heartbeats are: Premature ventricular contractions (PVC) Premature atrial contractions (PAC)Ectopic heartbeats are sometimes seen with: Changes in the blood, such as a low potassium level ( hypokalemia ) Decrease in blood supply to the heart When the heart is enlarged or structurally abnormal Ectopic beats may be caused or made worse by smoking, alcohol use , caffeine , stimulant medicines, and some street drugs. Ectopic heartbeats are rare in children without heart disease that was present at birth (congenital). Most extra heartbeats in children are PACs. These are often benign. In adults, ectopic heartbeats are common. They are most often due to PACs or PVCs. Your health care provider should look into the cause when they are frequent. Treatment is directed at symptoms and the underlying cause.

Heart block is a problem in the electrical signals in the heart. Normally, the heart beat starts in an area in the top chambers of the heart (atria). This area is the heart's pacemaker. The electrical signals travel to the lower chambers of the heart (ventricles). This keeps the heart beat steady and regular. Heart block occurs when the electrical signal is slowed down or does not reach the bottom chambers of the heart. Your heart may beat slowly, or it may skip beats. Heart block may resolve on its own, or it may be permanent and require treatment. There are three degrees of heart block. First-degree heart block is the mildest type and third-degree is the most severe. First-degree heart block: Rarely has symptoms or causes problems Second-degree heart block: The electrical impulse may not reach the lower chambers of the heart. The heart may miss a beat or beats and may be slow and irregular. You may feel dizzy, faint, or have other symptoms. This may be serious in some cases. Third-degree heart block: The electrical signal does not move to the lower chambers of the heart. In this case, the lower chambers beat at a much slower rate, and the upper and lower chambers do not beat sequentially (one after the other) as they do normally. The heart fails to pump enough blood to the body. This can lead to fainting and shortness of breath. This is an emergency that needs medical help right away.Heart block may be caused by: Side effects of medicines. Heart block can be a side effect of digitalis, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and other medicines. A heart attack that damages the electrical system in the heart. Heart diseases, such as heart valve disease and cardiac sarcoidosis. Some infections, such as Lyme disease. Heart surgery. You may have heart block because you were born with it. You are more at risk for this if: You have a heart defect. Your mother has an autoimmune disease, such as lupus. Some normal people, will have a first degree block especially at rest or when asleep. This most often occurs in young healthy people.

Palpitations are feelings or sensations that your heart is pounding or racing. They can be felt in your chest, throat, or neck. You may: Have an unpleasant awareness of your own heartbeat Feel like your heart skipped or stopped beats The heart's rhythm may be normal or abnormal when you have palpitations.Normally the heart beats 60 to 100 times per minute. The rate may drop below 60 beats per minute in people who exercise routinely or take medicines that slow the heart. If your heart rate is fast (over 100 beats per minute), this is called tachycardia. A heart rate slower than 60 is called bradycardia. An occasional extra heartbeat out of rhythm is known as extrasystole . Palpitations are not serious most of the time. Sensations representing an abnormal heart rhythm ( arrhythmia ) may be more serious. The following conditions make you more likely to have an abnormal heart rhythm: Known heart disease at the time the palpitations begin Significant risk factors for heart disease An abnormal heart valve An electrolyte abnormality in your blood -- for example, a low potassium level



Intracardiac electrophysiology study (EPS) is a test to look at how well the heart's electrical signals are working. It is used to check for abnormal heartbeats or heart rhythms .Wire electrodes are placed in the heart to do this test. These electrodes measure electrical activity in the heart. The procedure is done in a hospital laboratory. The staff will include a cardiologist, technicians, and nurses. To have this study: Your groin and/or neck area will be cleaned and numbing medicine (anesthetic) will be applied to the skin. The cardiologist will then place several IVs (called sheaths) into the groin or neck area. Once these IVs are in place, wires or electrodes can be passed through the sheaths into your body. The doctor uses moving x-ray images to guide the catheter into the heart and place the electrodes in the right places. The electrodes pick up the heart's electrical signals. Electrical signals from the electrodes may be used to make the heart skip beats or produce an abnormal heart rhythm. This can help the doctor understand more about what is causing the abnormal heart rhythm or where in the heart it is starting. You may also be given medicines that may also be used for the same purpose. Other procedures that may also be done during the test: Placement of a heart pacemaker Procedure to modify small areas in your heart that may be causing your heart rhythm problems (called catheter ablation ) Watch this video about: Cardiac conduction system

Multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT) is a rapid heart rate . It occurs when too many signals (electrical impulses) are sent from the upper heart (atria) to the lower heart (ventricles).The human heart gives off electrical impulses, or signals, which tell it to beat. Normally, these signals begin in an area of the upper right chamber called the sinoatrial node (sinus node or SA node). This node is considered the heart's "natural pacemaker." It helps control the heartbeat. When the heart detects a signal, it contracts (or beats). The normal heart rate in adults is about 60 to 100 beats per minute. The normal heart rate is faster in children. In MAT, many locations in the atria fire signals at the same time. Too many signals lead to a rapid heart rate. It most often ranges between 100 to 130 beats per minute or more in adults. The rapid heart rate causes the heart to work too hard and not move blood efficiently. If the heartbeat is very fast, there is less time for the heart chamber to fill with blood between beats. Therefore, not enough blood is pumped to the brain and the rest of the body with each contraction. MAT is most common in people age 50 and over. It is often seen in people with conditions that lower the amount of oxygen in the blood. These conditions include: Bacterial pneumonia Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Congestive heart failure Lung cancer Lung failure Pulmonary embolism You may be at higher risk for MAT if you have: Coronary heart disease Diabetes Had surgery within the last 6 weeks Overdosed on the drug theophylline Sepsis When the heart rate is less than 100 beats per minute, the arrhythmia is called "wandering atrial pacemaker."

Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) is episodes of rapid heart rate that start in a part of the heart above the ventricles. "Paroxysmal" means from time to time.Normally, the chambers of the heart (atria and ventricles) contract in a coordinated manner. The contractions are caused by an electrical signal that begins in an area of the heart called the sinoatrial node (also called the sinus node or SA node). The signal moves through the upper heart chambers (the atria) and tells the atria to contract. After this, the signal moves down in the heart and tells the lower chambers (the ventricles) to contract. The rapid heart rate from PSVT may start with events that occur in areas of the heart above the lower chambers (ventricles). There are a number of specific causes of PSVT. It can develop when doses of the heart medicine, digitalis, are too high. It can also occur with a condition known as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome , which is most often seen in young people and infants. The following increase your risk for PSVT: Alcohol use Caffeine use Illicit drug use Smoking

The pulse is the number of heartbeats per minute.The pulse can be measured at areas where an artery passes close to the skin. These areas include the: Back of the knees Groin Neck Temple Top or inner side of the foot Wrist To measure the pulse at your wrist, place your index and middle finger over the underside of your opposite wrist, below the base of the thumb. Press with flat fingers until you feel the pulse. To measure the pulse on the neck, place the index and middle fingers just to the side of the Adam's apple, in the soft, hollow area. Press gently until you locate the pulse. Note: Sit or lie down before taking the neck pulse. The neck arteries in some people are sensitive to pressure. Fainting or slowing of the heartbeat can result. Also, do not take the pulses on both sides of the neck at the same time. Doing so can slow the flow of blood to the head and lead to fainting. Once you find the pulse, count the beats for 1 full minute. Or, count the beats for 30 seconds and multiply by 2. This will give the beats per minute.

Normally, the heartbeat starts in an area in the top chambers of the heart (atria). This area is the heart's pacemaker. It is called the sinoatrial node, sinus node or SA node. Its role is to keep the heart beat steady and regular. Sick sinus syndrome is a group of heart rhythm problems due to problems with the sinus node, such as: The heartbeat rate is too slow, called sinus bradycardia The heartbeat pauses or stops, called sinus pauses or sinus arrest Episodes of a fast heart rate Slow heart rhythms that alternate with fast heart rhythms, called bradycardia-tachycardia or "tachy-brady syndrome"Sick sinus syndrome most often occurs in people older than age 50. It is often due to scar-like damage to electrical pathways in the heart muscle tissue. In children, heart surgery on the upper chambers is a common cause of sick sinus syndrome. Coronary heart disease , high blood pressure, and aortic and mitral valve diseases may occur with sick sinus syndrome. However, these diseases may have nothing to do with the syndrome. Sick sinus syndrome is uncommon, but not rare. It is the most common reason people need to have an artificial pacemaker implanted. Sinus bradycardia occurs more often than the other types of the condition. Tachycardias (rapid heart rhythms) that start in the upper chambers of the heart may be part of the syndrome. These include atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, atrial tachycardia. A period of fast heart rates is often followed by very slow heart rates. When there are periods of both slow and fast heart rates (rhythms) the condition often will be called tachy-brady syndrome. Some medicines can make abnormal heart rhythms worse, especially when doses are high. These include digitalis, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, and antiarrhythmics.

Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is a severely abnormal heart rhythm ( arrhythmia ) that is life threatening.The heart pumps blood to the lungs, brain, and other organs. If the heartbeat is interrupted, even for a few seconds, it can lead to fainting (syncope) or cardiac arrest. Fibrillation is an uncontrolled twitching or quivering of muscle fibers (fibrils). When it occurs in the lower chambers of the heart, it is called VF. During VF, blood is not pumped from the heart. Sudden cardiac death results. The most common cause of VF is a heart attack. However, VF can occur whenever the heart muscle does not get enough oxygen. Conditions that can lead to VF include: Electrocution accidents or injury to the heart Heart attack or angina Heart disease that is present at birth (congenital) Heart muscle disease in which the heart muscle becomes weakened and stretched or thickened Heart surgery Sudden cardiac death (commotio cordis); most often occurs in athletes who have had a sudden blow to the area directly over the heart Medicines Very high or very low potassium levels in the blood Many people with VF have no history of heart disease. However, they often have heart disease risk factors, such as smoking, high blood pressure, and diabetes.

Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a rapid heartbeat that starts in the lower chambers of the heart (ventricles).VT is a pulse rate of more than 100 beats per minute, with at least 3 irregular heartbeats in a row. The condition can develop as an early or late complication of a heart attack . It may also occur in people with: Cardiomyopathy Heart failure Heart surgery Myocarditis Valvular heart disease VT can occur without heart disease. Scar tissue may form in the muscle of the ventricles days, months, or years after a heart attack. This can lead to ventricular tachycardia. VT can also be caused by: Anti-arrhythmic drugs (used to treat an abnormal heart rhythm) Changes in blood chemistry (such as a low potassium level) Changes in pH (acid-base) Lack of enough oxygen "Torsade de pointes" is a specific form of VT. It is often due to congenital heart disease or the use of certain medicines.

Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a condition in which there is an extra electrical pathway in the heart that leads to periods of rapid heart rate ( tachycardia ). WPW syndrome is one of the most common causes of fast heart rate problems in infants and children.Normally, electrical signals follow a certain pathway through the heart. This helps the heart beat regularly. This prevents the heart from having extra beats or beats happening too soon. In people with WPW syndrome, some of the heart's electrical signals go down an extra pathway. This may cause a very rapid heart rate called supraventricular tachycardia. Most people with WPW syndrome do not have any other heart problems. However, this condition has been linked with other cardiac conditions, such as Ebstein anomaly . A form of the condition also runs in families.



Heart diseases are the number one killer in the U.S. They are also a major cause of disability. If you do have a heart disease, it is important to find it early, when it is easier to treat. Blood tests and heart health tests can help find heart diseases or identify problems that can lead to heart diseases. There are several different types of heart health tests. Your doctor will decide which test or tests you need, based on your symptoms (if any), risk factors, and medical history. Cardiac Catheterization Cardiac catheterization is a medical procedure used to diagnose and treat some heart conditions. For the procedure, your doctor puts a catheter (a long, thin, flexible tube) into a blood vessel in your arm, groin, or neck, and threads it to your heart. The doctor can use the catheter to: Do a coronary angiography. This involves putting a special type of dye in the catheter, so the dye can flow through your bloodstream to your heart. Then your doctor takes x-rays of your heart. The dye allows your doctor to see your coronary arteries on the x-ray, and to check for coronary artery disease (plaque buildup in the arteries). Take samples of blood and heart muscle Do procedures such as minor heart surgery or angioplasty , if your doctor finds that you need it Cardiac CT Scan A cardiac CT ( computed tomography ) scan is a painless imaging test that uses x-rays to take detailed pictures of your heart and its blood vessels. Computers can combine these pictures to create a three-dimensional (3D) model of the whole heart. This test can help doctors detect or evaluate: Coronary artery disease Calcium buildup in the coronary arteries Problems with the aorta Problems with heart function and valves Pericardial diseases Before you have the test, you get an injection of contrast dye. The dye highlights your heart and blood vessels in the pictures. The CT scanner is a large, tunnel-like machine. You lie still on a table which slides you into the scanner, and the scanner takes the pictures for about 15 minutes. Cardiac MRI Cardiac MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) is a painless imaging test that uses radio waves, magnets, and a computer to create detailed pictures of your heart. It can help your doctor figure out whether you have heart disease, and if so, how severe it is. A cardiac MRI can also help your doctor decide the best way to treat heart problems such as: Coronary artery disease Heart valve problems Pericarditis Cardiac tumors Damage from a heart attack The MRI is a large, tunnel-like machine. You lie still on a table which slides you into the MRI machine. The machine makes loud noises as it takes pictures of your heart. It usually takes about 30-90 minutes. Sometimes before the test, you might get an injection of contrast dye. The dye highlights your heart and blood vessels in the pictures. Chest X-Ray A chest x-ray creates pictures of the organs and structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. It can reveal signs of heart failure , as well as lung disorders and other causes of symptoms not related to heart disease. Coronary Angiography Coronary angiography (angiogram) is a procedure that uses contrast dye and x-ray pictures to look at the insides of your arteries. It can show whether plaque is blocking your arteries and how severe the blockage is. Doctors use this procedure to diagnose heart diseases after chest pain , sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), or abnormal results from other heart tests such as an EKG or a stress test. You usually have a cardiac catheterization to get the dye into your coronary arteries. Then you have special x-rays while the dye is flowing through your coronary arteries. The dye lets your doctor study the flow of blood through your heart and blood vessels. Echocardiography Echocardiography, or echo, is a painless test that uses sound waves to create moving pictures of your heart. The pictures show the size and shape of your heart. They also show how well your heart's chambers and valves are working. Doctors use an echo to diagnose many different heart problems, and to check how severe they are. For the test, a technician applies gel to your chest. The gel helps sound waves reach your heart. The technician moves a transducer (wand-like device) around on your chest. The transducer connects to a computer. It transmits ultrasound waves into your chest, and the waves bounce (echo) back. The computer converts the echoes into pictures of your heart. Electrocardiogram (EKG), (ECG) An electrocardiogram, also called an ECG or EKG, is a painless test that detects and records your heart's electrical activity. It shows how fast your heart is beating and whether its rhythm is steady or irregular. An EKG may be part of a routine exam to screen for heart disease. Or you may get it to detect and study heart problems such as heart attacks, arrhythmia , and heart failure. For the test, you lie still on a table and a nurse or technician attaches electrodes (patches that have sensors) to the skin on your chest, arms, and legs. Wires connect the electrodes to a machine that records your heart's electrical activity. Stress Testing Stress testing looks at how your heart works during physical stress. It can help to diagnose coronary artery disease, and to check how severe it is. It can also check for other problems, including heart valve disease and heart failure. For the test, you exercise (or are given medicine if you are unable to exercise) to make your heart work hard and beat fast. While this is happening, you get an EKG and blood pressure monitoring. Sometimes you may also have an echocardiogram, or other imaging tests such as a nuclear scan . For the nuclear scan, you get an injection of a tracer (a radioactive substance), which travels to your heart. Special cameras detect the energy from the tracer to make pictures of your heart. You have pictures taken after you exercise, and then after you rest. NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute









When you're dizzy, you may feel lightheaded, woozy, or disoriented. If you feel like you or the room are spinning, you have vertigo. These feelings may make you lose your balance . Dizziness can have many different causes. A sudden drop in blood pressure or being dehydrated can make you dizzy. Many people feel lightheaded if they get up too quickly from sitting or lying down. Certain medicines and problems with your inner ear may cause dizziness. So can motion sickness . Sometimes dizziness can be a symptom of other disorders. As people get older, they may have more health problems and take more medicines. This makes them more likely to have problems with dizziness and balance. Dizziness usually gets better by itself or is easily treated. If you are dizzy often, you should see your health care provider to find the cause. NIH: National Institutes of Health

Have you ever felt dizzy , lightheaded, or as if the room is spinning around you? If the feeling happens often, it could be a sign of a balance problem. Balance problems can make you feel unsteady. You may also have blurred vision, confusion, and disorientation. They are one cause of falls and fall-related injuries, such as a hip fracture (broken hip). Some balance problems are due to problems in the inner ear. Others may involve another part of the body, such as the brain or the heart. Aging, infections, head injury, certain medicines, or problems with blood circulation may also cause balance problems. It is important to see your doctor about balance problems. They can be a sign of other health problems, such as an ear infection or a stroke. Your doctor may send you to a specialist for a diagnosis. You may need a hearing test, blood tests, or imaging studies of your head and brain. Other possible tests look at your eye movements, and how your body responds to movement. In some cases, treating the illness that is causing the disorder will help with the balance problem. Exercises, a change in diet, and some medicines also can help. NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders

You've probably heard that high blood pressure is a problem. Sometimes blood pressure that is too low can also cause problems. Blood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Each time your heart beats, it pumps out blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure is highest when your heart beats, pumping the blood. This is called systolic pressure. When your heart is at rest, between beats, your blood pressure falls. This is the diastolic pressure. Your blood pressure reading uses these two numbers. Usually they're written one above or before the other, such as 120/80. If your blood pressure reading is 90/60 or lower, you have low blood pressure. Some people have low blood pressure all the time. They have no symptoms and their low readings are normal for them. In other people, blood pressure drops below normal because of a medical condition or certain medicines. Some people may have symptoms of low blood pressure when standing up too quickly.  Low blood pressure is a problem only if it causes dizziness , fainting or in extreme cases, shock . NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute

What is dehydration? Dehydration is condition caused by the loss of too much fluid from the body .  It happens when you are losing more fluids than you are taking in, and your body does not have enough fluids to work properly. What causes dehydration? You can become dehydrated because of: Diarrhea Vomiting Sweating too much Urinating too much, which can happen because of certain medicines and illnesses Fever Not drinking enough Who is at risk for dehydration? Certain people have a higher risk of dehydration: Older adults. Some people lose their sense of thirst as they age, so they don't drink enough fluids. Infants and young children, who are more likely to have diarrhea or vomiting People with chronic illnesses that cause them to urinate or sweat more often, such as diabetes , cystic fibrosis , or kidney problems People who take medicines that cause them to urinate or sweat more People who exercise or work outdoors during hot weather What are the symptoms of dehydration? In adults , the symptoms of dehydration include: Feeling very thirsty Dry mouth Urinating and sweating less than usual Dark-colored urine Dry skin Feeling tired Dizziness In infants and young children , the symptoms of dehydration include: Dry mouth and tongue Crying without tears No wet diapers for 3 hours or more A high fever Being unusually sleepy or drowsy Irritability Eyes that look sunken Dehydration can be mild, or it can be severe enough to be life-threatening. Get medical help right away if the symptoms also include: Confusion Fainting Lack of urination Rapid heartbeat Rapid breathing Shock How is dehydration diagnosed? To make a diagnosis, your health care provider will: Do a physical exam Check your vital signs Ask about your symptoms You may also have: Blood tests to check your electrolyte levels, especially potassium and sodium . Electrolytes are minerals in your body that have an electric charge. They have many important jobs, including helping to keep a balance of fluids in your body. Blood tests to check your kidney function Urine tests to check for dehydration and its cause What are the treatments for dehydration? The treatment for dehydration is to replace the fluids and electrolytes that you have lost. For mild cases, you may just need to drink lots of water. If you lost electrolytes, sports drinks may help. There are also oral rehydration solutions for children. You can buy those without a prescription. Severe cases may be treated with intravenous (IV) fluids with salt in a hospital. Can dehydration be prevented? The key to preventing dehydration is making sure that you get enough fluids: Drink enough water every day. Each person's needs can be different, so ask your health care provider how much you should be drinking each day. If you are exercising in the heat and losing a lot of minerals in sweat, sports drinks can be helpful Avoid drinks that have sugar and caffeine Drink extra fluids when the weather is hot or when you are sick

Your ear has three main parts: outer, middle and inner. You use all of them in hearing. Sound waves come in through your outer ear. They reach your middle ear, where they make your eardrum vibrate. The vibrations are transmitted through three tiny bones, called ossicles, in your middle ear. The vibrations travel to your inner ear, a snail-shaped organ. The inner ear makes the nerve impulses that are sent to the brain. Your brain recognizes them as sounds. The inner ear also controls balance. A variety of conditions may affect your hearing or balance : Ear infections are the most common illness in infants and young children. Tinnitus , a roaring in your ears, can be the result of loud noises, medicines or a variety of other causes. Meniere's disease may be the result of fluid problems in your inner ear; its symptoms include tinnitus and dizziness. Ear barotrauma is an injury to your ear because of changes in barometric (air) or water pressure. Some ear disorders can result in hearing disorders and deafness .

Motion sickness is a common problem in people traveling by car, train, airplanes, and 
especially boats. Anyone can get it, but it is more common in children, pregnant women, and people taking certain medicines. Motion sickness can start suddenly, with a queasy feeling and cold sweats. It can then lead to dizziness and nausea and vomiting . Your brain senses movement by getting signals from your inner ears, eyes, muscles, and joints. When it gets signals that do not match, you can get motion sickness. For example, if you are reading on your phone while riding a bus, your eyes are focused on something that is not moving, but your inner ear senses motion. Where you sit can make a difference. The front seat of a car, forward cars of a train, upper deck on a boat or wing seats in a plane may give you a smoother ride. Looking out into the distance - instead of trying to read or look at something in the vehicle - can also help. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention



Benign positional vertigo is the most common type of vertigo. Vertigo is the feeling that you are spinning or that everything is spinning around you. It may occur when you move your head in a certain position.Benign positional vertigo is also called benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). It is caused by a problem in the inner ear. The inner ear has fluid-filled tubes called semicircular canals. When you move, the fluid moves inside these tubes. The canals are very sensitive to any movement of the fluid. The sensation of the fluid moving in the tube tells your brain the position of your body. This helps you keep your balance. BPPV occurs when small pieces of bone-like calcium (called canaliths) breaks free and floats inside the tube. This sends confusing messages to your brain about your body's position. BPPV has no major risk factors. But, your risk of developing BPPV may increase if you have: Family members with BPPV Had a prior head injury (even a slight bump to the head) Had an inner ear infection called labyrinthitis

You may have seen your health care provider because you have had benign positional vertigo . It is also called benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, or BPPV. BPPV is the most common cause of vertigo and the easiest to treat.Your provider may have treated your vertigo with the Epley maneuver . These are head movements that correct the inner ear problem that causes BPPV. After you go home: For the rest of the day, do not bend over. For several days after treatment, do not sleep on the side that triggers symptoms. Follow any other specific instructions your provider gave you. Most of the time, treatment will cure BPPV. Sometimes, vertigo may return after a few weeks. About half the time, BPPV will come back later on. If this happens, you will need to be treated again. Your provider may prescribe medicines that can help relieve spinning sensations. But, these medicines often do not work well for treating the actual vertigo.

Caloric stimulation is a test that uses differences in temperature to diagnose damage to the acoustic nerve. This is the nerve that is involved in hearing and balance. The test also checks for damage to the brain stem.This test stimulates your acoustic nerve by delivering cold or warm water or air into your ear canal. When cold water or air enters your ear and the inner ear changes temperature, it should cause fast, side-to-side eye movements called nystagmus . The test is done in the following way: Before the test, your ear, especially the eardrum, will be checked. This is to make sure it is normal. One ear is tested at a time. A small amount of cold water or air is gently delivered into one of your ears. Your eyes should show an involuntary movement called nystagmus. Then they should turn away from that ear and slowly back. If water is used, it is allowed to drain out of the ear canal. Next, a small amount of warm water or air is gently delivered into the same ear. Again, your eyes should show nystagmus. Then they should turn toward that ear and slowly back. Your other ear is tested in the same way. During the test, the health care provider may observe your eyes directly. Most often, this test is done as part of another test called electronystagmography .

Dizziness is a term that is often used to describe 2 different symptoms: lightheadedness and vertigo. Lightheadedness is a feeling that you might faint. Vertigo is a feeling that you are spinning or moving, or that the world is spinning around you. Vertigo-associated disorders is a related topic.Most causes of dizziness are not serious, and they either quickly get better on their own or are easy to treat.

Dizziness can describe a variety of symptoms. You may feel lightheaded, woozy, unsteady, or like you might faint. Dizziness can also describe the feeling that you are spinning or moving, or you feel like the world is spinning around you. This is called vertigo. The feeling of spinning: Often starts suddenly Is usually started by moving the head Lasts a few seconds to minutes This article is about self-care for vertigo.Most often, people say the spinning feeling can start when they roll over in bed or tilt their head up to look at something. Along with dizziness and vertigo, you may also have: Nausea and vomiting Hearing loss Ringing in your ears (tinnitus) Vision problems, such as a feeling that things are jumping or moving Loss of balance, difficulty standing up Mild dizziness usually gets better by itself, or is easily treated. However, it can be a symptom of other problems. There are many causes. Medicines may cause dizziness, or problems with your ear. Motion sickness can also make you dizzy. Vertigo can be a symptom of many disorders, as well. Some may be chronic, long-term conditions. Some may come and go. Depending on the cause of your vertigo, you may have other symptoms, like benign positional vertigo or Meniere disease . It is important to have your health care provider decide if your vertigo is a sign of a serious problem.

Electronystagmography is a test that looks at eye movements to see how well nerves in the brain are working. These nerves are: Vestibular nerve (eighth cranial nerve), which runs from the brain to the ears Oculomotor nerve, which controls eye movement Trochlear and abducens nerves, which run from the brain to the eyesPatches called electrodes are placed above, below, and on each side of your eyes. They may be sticky patches or attached to a headband. Another patch is attached to the forehead. The health care provider will spray cold water or air into each ear canal at separate times. The patches record eye movements that occur when the inner ear and nearby nerves are stimulated by the water or air. When cold water enters the ear, you should have rapid, side-to-side eye movements called nystagmus. Next, warm water or air is placed into the ear. The eyes should now move rapidly toward the warm water then slowly away. You may also be asked to use your eyes to track objects, such as flashing lights or moving lines. The test takes about 90 minutes.

The Epley maneuver is a series of head movements to relieve symptoms of benign positional vertigo . Benign positional vertigo is also called benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). BPPV is caused by a problem in the inner ear. Vertigo is the feeling that you are spinning or that everything is spinning around you.BPPV occurs when small pieces of bone-like calcium (canaliths) break free and float inside small canals in your inner ear. This sends confusing messages to your brain about your body's position, which causes vertigo. The Epley maneuver is used to move the canaliths out of the canals so they stop causing symptoms. To perform the maneuver, your health care provider will: Turn your head toward the side that causes vertigo. Quickly lay you down on your back with your head in the same position just off the edge of the table. You will likely feel more intense vertigo symptoms at this point. Slowly move your head to the opposite side. Turn your body so that it is in line with your head. You will be lying on your side with your head and body facing to the side. Sit you upright. Your provider may need to repeat these steps a few times.

Labyrinthitis is irritation and swelling of the inner ear. It can cause vertigo and hearing loss.Labyrinthitis is usually caused by a virus and sometimes by bacteria. Having a cold or flu can trigger the condition. Less often, an ear infection may lead to labyrinthitis. Other causes include allergies or certain medicines that are bad for the inner ear. Your inner ear is important for both hearing and balance. When you have labyrinthitis, the parts of your inner ear become irritated and swollen. This can make you lose your balance and cause hearing loss. These factors raise your risk for labyrinthitis: Drinking large amounts of alcohol Fatigue History of allergies Recent viral illness, respiratory infection , or ear infection Smoking Stress Using certain prescription or nonprescription medicines (such as aspirin)

You may have seen your health care provider because you have had labyrinthitis . This inner ear problem can cause you to feel like you are spinning (vertigo). Most of the worst symptoms of vertigo will go away within a week. However, you may feel dizzy at times for another 2 to 3 months.Being dizzy can cause you to lose your balance, fall, and hurt yourself. These tips can help keep symptoms from getting worse and keep you safe: When you feel dizzy, sit down right away. To get up from a lying position, slowly sit up and stay seated for a few moments before standing. When standing, make sure you have something to hold on to. Avoid sudden movements or position changes. You may need a cane or other help walking when symptoms are severe. Avoid bright lights, TV, and reading during a vertigo attack. They may make symptoms worse. Avoid activities such as driving, operating heavy machinery, and climbing while you are having symptoms. Drink water, especially if you have nausea and vomiting. If symptoms continue, ask your provider about balance therapy. Balance therapy includes head, eye, and body exercises you can do at home to help train your brain to overcome dizziness. Symptoms of labyrinthitis can cause stress. Make healthy lifestyle choices to help you cope, such as: Eat a well-balanced, healthy diet. Do not overeat. Exercise regularly, if possible. Get enough sleep. Limit caffeine and alcohol. Help ease stress by using relaxation techniques, such as: Deep breathing Guided imagery Meditation Progressive muscle relaxation Tai chi Yoga Quit smoking

Vertigo is a sensation of motion or spinning that is often described as dizziness. Vertigo is not the same as being lightheaded . People with vertigo feel as though they are actually spinning or moving, or that the world is spinning around them.There are two types of vertigo, peripheral and central vertigo. Peripheral vertigo is due to a problem in the part of the inner ear that controls balance. These areas are called the vestibular labyrinth, or semicircular canals. The problem may also involve the vestibular nerve. This is the nerve between the inner ear and the brain stem. Peripheral vertigo may be caused by: Benign positional vertigo (benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, also known as BPPV) Certain medicines, such as aminoglycoside antibiotics, cisplatin, diuretics, or salicylates, which are toxic to the inner ear structures Injury (such as head injury) Inflammation of the vestibular nerve (neuronitis) Irritation and swelling of the inner ear ( labyrinthitis ) Meniere disease Pressure on the vestibular nerve, usually from a noncancerous tumor such as a meningioma or schwannoma Central vertigo is due to a problem in the brain, usually in the brain stem or the back part of the brain (cerebellum). Central vertigo may be caused by: Blood vessel disease Certain drugs, such as anticonvulsants, aspirin, and alcohol Multiple sclerosis Seizures (rarely) Stroke Tumors (cancerous or noncancerous) Vestibular migraine, a type of migraine headache



Meniere's disease is a disorder of the inner ear. It can cause severe dizziness , a roaring sound in your ears called tinnitus , hearing loss that comes and goes and the feeling of ear pressure or pain. It usually affects just one ear. It is a common cause of hearing loss. Attacks of dizziness may come on suddenly or after a short period of tinnitus or muffled hearing. Some people have single attacks of dizziness once in a while. Others may have many attacks close together over several days. Some people with Meniere's disease have "drop attacks" during which the  dizziness is so bad they lose their balance and fall. Scientists don't yet know the cause. They think that it has to do with the fluid levels or the mixing of fluids in the canals of your inner ear.  Doctors diagnose it based on a physical exam and your symptoms. A hearing test can check to see how it has affected your hearing. There is no cure. Treatments include medicines to control dizziness, limiting salt in your diet, and taking water pills. A device that fits into the outer ear and delivers air pulses to the middle ear can help. Severe cases may require surgery. NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders







When you're short of breath, it's hard or uncomfortable for you to take in the oxygen your body needs. You may feel as if you're not getting enough air. Sometimes you can have mild breathing problems because of a stuffy nose or intense exercise. But shortness of breath can also be a sign of a serious disease. Many conditions can make you feel short of breath: Lung conditions such as asthma , emphysema , or pneumonia Problems with your trachea or bronchi , which are part of your airway system Heart disease can make you feel breathless if your heart cannot pump enough blood to supply oxygen to your body Anxiety and panic attacks Allergies If you often have trouble breathing, it is important to find out the cause.

What is asthma? Asthma is a chronic (long-term) lung disease. It affects your airways, the tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. When you have asthma, your airways can become inflamed and narrowed. This can cause wheezing, coughing , and tightness in your chest. When these symptoms get worse than usual, it is called an asthma attack or flare-up. What causes asthma? The exact cause of asthma is unknown. Genetics and your environment likely play a role in who gets asthma. An asthma attack can happen when you are exposed to an asthma trigger. An asthma trigger is something that can set off or worsen your asthma symptoms. Different triggers can cause different types of asthma: Allergic asthma is caused by allergens. Allergens are substances that cause an allergic reaction. They can include Dust mites Mold Pets Pollen from grass, trees, and weeds Waste from pests such as cockroaches and mice Nonallergic asthma is caused by triggers that are not allergens, such as Breathing in cold air Certain medicines Household chemicals Infections such as colds and the flu Outdoor air pollution Tobacco smoke Occupational asthma is caused by breathing in chemicals or industrial dusts at work Exercise-induced asthma happens during physical exercise, especially when the air is dry Asthma triggers may be different for each person and can change over time. Who is at risk for asthma? Asthma affects people of all ages, but it often starts during childhood. Certain factors can raise your risk of having asthma: Being exposed to secondhand smoke when your mother is pregnant with you or when you are a small child Being exposed to certain substances at work , such as chemical irritants or industrial dusts Genetics and family history. You are more likely to have asthma if one of your parents has it, especially if it's your mother. Race or ethnicity. Black and African Americans and Puerto Ricans are at higher risk of asthma than people of other races or ethnicities. Having other diseases or conditions such as obesity and allergies Often having viral respiratory infections as a young child Sex. In children, asthma is more common in boys. In teens and adults, it is more common in women. What are the symptoms of asthma? The symptoms of asthma include: Chest tightness Coughing, especially at night or early morning Shortness of breath Wheezing, which causes a whistling sound when you breathe out These symptoms can range from mild to severe. You may have them every day or only once in a while. When you are having an asthma attack, your symptoms get much worse. The attacks may come on gradually or suddenly. Sometimes they can be life-threatening. They are more common in people who have severe asthma. If you are having asthma attacks, you may need a change in your treatment. How is asthma diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to diagnose asthma: Physical exam Medical history Lung function tests , including spirometry, to test how well your lungs work Tests to measure how your airways react to specific exposures. During this test, you inhale different concentrations of allergens or medicines that may tighten the muscles in your airways. Spirometry is done before and after the test. Peak expiratory flow (PEF) tests to measure how fast you can blow air out using maximum effort Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) tests to measure levels of nitric oxide in your breath when you breathe out. High levels of nitric oxide may mean that your lungs are inflamed. Allergy skin or blood tests, if you have a history of allergies. These tests check which allergens cause a reaction from your immune system. What are the treatments for asthma? If you have asthma, you will work with your health care provider to create a treatment plan. The plan will include ways to manage your asthma symptoms and prevent asthma attacks. It will include: Strategies to avoid triggers. For example, if tobacco smoke is a trigger for you, you should not smoke or allow other people to smoke in your home or car. Short-term relief medicines, also called quick-relief medicines. They help prevent symptoms or relieve symptoms during an asthma attack. They include an inhaler to carry with you all the time. It may also include other types of medicines which work quickly to help open your airways. Control medicines. You take them every day to help prevent symptoms. They work by reducing airway inflammation and preventing narrowing of the airways. If you have a severe attack and the short-term relief medicines do not work, you will need emergency care. Your provider may adjust your treatment until asthma symptoms are controlled. Sometimes asthma is severe and cannot be controlled with other treatments. If you are an adult with uncontrolled asthma, in some cases your provider might suggest bronchial thermoplasty. This is a procedure that uses heat to shrink the smooth muscle in the lungs. Shrinking the muscle reduces your airway's ability to tighten and allows you to breathe more easily. The procedure has some risks, so it's important to discuss them with your provider.

What is emphysema? Emphysema is a type of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). COPD is a group of lung diseases that make it hard to breathe and get worse over time. The other main type of COPD is chronic bronchitis . Most people with COPD have both emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but how severe each type is can be different from person to person. Emphysema affects the air sacs in your lungs. Normally, these sacs are elastic or stretchy. When you breathe in, each air sac fills up with air, like a small balloon. When you breathe out, the air sacs deflate, and the air goes out. In emphysema, the walls between many of the air sacs in the lungs are damaged. This causes the air sacs to lose their shape and become floppy. The damage also can destroy the walls of the air sacs, leading to fewer and larger air sacs instead of many tiny ones. This makes it harder for your lungs to move oxygen in and carbon dioxide out of your body. What causes emphysema? The cause of emphysema is usually long-term exposure to irritants that damage your lungs and the airways. In the United States, cigarette smoke is the main cause. Pipe, cigar, and other types of tobacco smoke can also cause emphysema, especially if you inhale them. Exposure to other inhaled irritants can contribute to emphysema. These include secondhand smoke , air pollution , and chemical fumes or dusts from the environment or workplace. Rarely, a genetic condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can play a role in causing emphysema. Who is at risk for emphysema? The risk factors for emphysema include: Smoking. This the main risk factor. Up to 75% of people who have emphysema smoke or used to smoke. Long-term exposure to other lung irritants , such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, and chemical fumes and dusts from the environment or workplace. Age. Most people who have emphysema are at least 40 years old when their symptoms begin. Genetics. This includes alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, which is a genetic condition. Also, smokers who get emphysema are more likely to get it if they have a family history of COPD. What are the symptoms of emphysema? At first, you may have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. As the disease gets worse, your symptoms usually become more severe. They can include: Frequent coughing or wheezing A cough that produces a lot mucus Shortness of breath, especially with physical activity A whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe Tightness in your chest Some people with emphysema get frequent respiratory infections such as colds and the flu . In severe cases, emphysema can cause weight loss, weakness in your lower muscles, and swelling in your ankles, feet, or legs. How is emphysema diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis: A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms A family history Other tests tests, such as lung function tests , a chest x-ray or CT scan , and blood tests What are the treatments for emphysema? There is no cure for emphysema. However, treatments can help with symptoms, slow the progress of the disease, and improve your ability to stay active. There are also treatments to prevent or treat complications of the disease. Treatments include: Lifestyle changes , such as Quitting smoking if you are a smoker. This is the most important step you can take to treat emphysema. Avoiding secondhand smoke and places where you might breathe in other lung irritants Ask your health care provider for an eating plan that will meet your nutritional needs. Also ask about how much physical activity you can do. Physical activity can strengthen the muscles that help you breathe and improve your overall wellness. Medicines , such as Bronchodilators, which relax the muscles around your airways. This helps open your airways and makes breathing easier. Most bronchodilators are taken through an inhaler. In more severe cases, the inhaler may also contain steroids to reduce inflammation. Vaccines for the flu and pneumococcal pneumonia, since people with emphysema are at higher risk for serious problems from these diseases Antibiotics if you get a bacterial or viral lung infection Oxygen therapy , if you have severe emphysema and low levels of oxygen in your blood. Oxygen therapy can help you breathe better. You may need extra oxygen all the time or only at certain times. Pulmonary rehabilitation , which is a program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic breathing problems. It may include An exercise program Disease management training Nutritional counseling Psychological counseling Surgery , usually as a last resort for people who have severe symptoms that have not gotten better with medicines. There are surgeries to Remove damaged lung tissue Remove large air spaces (bullae) that can form when air sacs are destroyed. The bullae can interfere with breathing. Do a lung transplant . This is might be an option if you have very severe emphysema. If you have emphysema, it's important to know when and where to get help for your symptoms. You should get emergency care if you have severe symptoms, such as trouble catching your breath or talking. Call your health care provider if your symptoms are getting worse or if you have signs of an infection, such as a fever . Can emphysema be prevented? Since smoking causes most cases of emphysema, the best way to prevent it is to not smoke. It's also important to try to avoid lung irritants such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, chemical fumes, and dusts. NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute

What is pneumonia? Pneumonia is an infection in one or both of the lungs. It causes the air sacs of the lungs to fill up with fluid or pus. It can range from mild to severe, depending on the type of germ causing the infection, your age, and your overall health. What causes pneumonia? Bacterial , viral , and fungal infections can cause pneumonia. Bacteria are the most common cause. Bacterial pneumonia can occur on its own. It can also develop after you've had certain viral infections such as a cold or the flu . Several different types of bacteria can cause pneumonia, including: Streptococcus pneumoniae Legionella pneumophila; this pneumonia is often called Legionnaires' disease Mycoplasma pneumoniae Chlamydia pneumoniae Haemophilus influenzae Viruses that infect the respiratory tract may cause pneumonia. Viral pneumonia is often mild and goes away on its own within a few weeks. But sometimes it is serious enough that you need to get treatment in a hospital. If you have viral pneumonia, you are at risk of also getting bacterial pneumonia. The different viruses that can cause pneumonia include: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) Some common cold and flu viruses SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 Fungal pneumonia is more common in people who have chronic health problems or weakened immune systems. Some of the types include: Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) Coccidioidomycosis, which causes valley fever Histoplasmosis Cryptococcus Who is at risk for pneumonia? Anyone can get pneumonia, but certain factors can increase your risk: Age; the risk is higher for children who are age 2 and under and adults age 65 and older Exposure to certain chemicals, pollutants, or toxic fumes Lifestyle habits, such as smoking , heavy alcohol use , and malnourishment Being in a hospital, especially if you are in the ICU . Being sedated and/or on a ventilator raises the risk even more. Having a lung disease Having a weakened immune system Have trouble coughing or swallowing , from a stroke or other condition Recently being sick with a cold or the flu What are the symptoms of pneumonia? The symptoms of pneumonia can range from mild to severe and include: Fever Chills Cough, usually with phlegm (a slimy substance from deep in your lungs) Shortness of breath Chest pain when you breathe or cough Nausea and/or vomiting Diarrhea The symptoms can vary for different groups. Newborns and infants may not show any signs of the infection. Others may vomit and have a fever and cough. They might seem sick, with no energy, or be restless. Older adults and people who have serious illnesses or weak immune systems may have fewer and milder symptoms. They may even have a lower than normal temperature. Older adults who have pneumonia sometimes have sudden changes in mental awareness. What other problems can pneumonia cause? Sometimes pneumonia can cause serious complications such as: Bacteremia, which happens when the bacteria move into the bloodstream. It is serious and can lead to septic shock . Lung abscesses , which are collections of pus in cavities of the lungs Pleural disorders , which are conditions that affect the pleura. The pleura is the tissue that covers the outside of the lungs and lines the inside of your chest cavity. Kidney failure Respiratory failure How is pneumonia diagnosed? Sometimes pneumonia can be hard to diagnose. This is because it can cause some of the same symptoms as a cold or the flu. It may take time for you to realize that you have a more serious condition. Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis: A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms A physical exam, including listening to your lungs with a stethoscope Various tests, such as A chest x-ray Blood tests such as a complete blood count (CBC) to see if your immune system is actively fighting an infection A Blood culture to find out whether you have a bacterial infection that has spread to your bloodstream If you are in the hospital, have serious symptoms, are older, or have other health problems, you may also have more tests, such as: Sputum test, which checks for bacteria in a sample of your sputum (spit) or phlegm (slimy substance from deep in your lungs). Chest CT scan to see how much of your lungs is affected. It may also show if you have complications such as lung abscesses or pleural effusions. Pleural fluid culture , which checks for bacteria in a fluid sample that was taken from the pleural space Pulse oximetry or blood oxygen level test, to check how much oxygen is in your blood Bronchoscopy, a procedure used to look inside your lungs' airways What are the treatments for pneumonia? Treatment for pneumonia depends on the type of pneumonia, which germ is causing it, and how severe it is: Antibiotics treat bacterial pneumonia and some types of fungal pneumonia. They do not work for viral pneumonia. In some cases, your provider may prescribe antiviral medicines for viral pneumonia Antifungal medicines treat other types of fungal pneumonia You may need to be treated in a hospital if your symptoms are severe or if you are at risk for complications. While there, you may get additional treatments. For example, if your blood oxygen level is low, you may receive oxygen therapy . It may take time to recover from pneumonia. Some people feel better within a week. For other people, it can take a month or more. Can pneumonia be prevented? Vaccines can help prevent pneumonia caused by pneumococcal bacteria or the flu virus . Having good hygiene , not smoking, and having a healthy lifestyle may also help prevent pneumonia. NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute

Your trachea, or windpipe, is one part of your airway system. Airways are pipes that carry oxygen-rich air to your lungs. They also carry carbon dioxide, a waste gas, out of your lungs. When you inhale, air travels from your nose, through your larynx, and down your windpipe. The windpipe splits into two bronchi that enter your lungs. Problems with the trachea include narrowing, inflammation, and some inherited conditions.  You may need a procedure called a tracheostomy to help you breathe if you have swallowing problems, or have conditions that affect coughing or block your airways.  You might also need a tracheostomy if you are in critical care and need to be on a breathing machine. NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute

When you breathe in, the air travels down through your trachea (windpipe). It then goes through two tubes to your lungs. These tubes are your bronchi. Bronchial disorders can make it hard for you to breathe. The most common problem with the bronchi is bronchitis, an inflammation of the tubes. It can be acute or chronic . Other problems include: Bronchiectasis - a condition in which damage to the airways causes them to widen and become flabby and scarred Exercise-induced bronchospasm - a breathing problem that happens when your airways shrink while you are exercising Bronchiolitis - an inflammation of the small airways that branch off from the bronchi Bronchopulmonary dysplasia - a chronic lung condition in infants, most often premature infants







An allergy is a reaction by your immune system to something that does not bother most other people. People who have allergies often are sensitive to more than one thing. Substances that often cause reactions are: Pollen Dust mites Mold spores Pet dander Food Insect stings Medicines Normally, your immune system fights germs. It is your body's defense system. In most allergic reactions, however, it is responding to a false alarm. Genes and the environment probably both play a role. Allergies can cause a variety of symptoms such as a runny nose, sneezing, itching, rashes , swelling, or asthma . Allergies can range from minor to severe. Anaphylaxis is a severe reaction that can be life-threatening.   Doctors use skin and blood tests to diagnose allergies. Treatments include medicines, allergy shots, and avoiding the substances that cause the reactions.



Blood gases are a measurement of how much oxygen and carbon dioxide are in your blood. They also determine the acidity (pH) of your blood.Usually, blood is taken from an artery. In some cases, blood from a vein may be used (venous blood gas). Most commonly, blood may be collected from one of the following arteries: Radial artery in the wrist Femoral artery in the groin Brachial artery in the arm The health care provider may test circulation to the hand before taking a sample of blood from the wrist area. The provider inserts a small needle through the skin into the artery. The sample is quickly sent to a laboratory for analysis.

Some children have breath-holding spells. This is an involuntary stop in breathing that is not in the child's control.Babies as young as 2 months old and up to 2 years old can start having breath-holding spells. Some children have severe spells. Children can have breath-holding spells when they are responding to: Fear Pain Traumatic event Being startled or confronted Breath-holding spells are more common in children with: Genetic conditions, such as Riley-Day syndrome or Rett syndrome Iron deficiency anemia A family history of breath-holding spells (parents may have had similar spells when they were children)

Breath sounds are the noises produced by the structures of the lungs during breathing.The breath sounds are best heard with a stethoscope. This is called auscultation. Normal breath sounds occur in all parts of the chest area, including above the collarbones and at the bottom of the rib cage. Using a stethoscope, the doctor may hear normal breathing sounds, decreased or absent breath sounds, and abnormal breath sounds. Absent or decreased sounds can mean: Air or fluid in or around the lungs (such as pneumonia , heart failure , and pleural effusion ) Increased thickness of the chest wall Over-inflation of a part of the lungs ( emphysema can cause this) Reduced airflow to part of the lungs There are several types of abnormal breath sounds. The 4 most common are: Rales. Small clicking, bubbling, or rattling sounds in the lungs. They are heard when a person breathes in (inhales). They are believed to occur when air opens closed air spaces. Rales can be further described as moist, dry, fine, or coarse. Rhonchi. Sounds that resemble snoring. They occur when air is blocked or air flow becomes rough through the large airways. Stridor. Wheeze-like sound heard when a person breathes. Usually it is due to a blockage of airflow in the windpipe (trachea) or in the back of the throat. Wheezing. High-pitched sounds produced by narrowed airways. Wheezing and other abnormal sounds can sometimes be heard without a stethoscope.



Breathing that stops from any cause is called apnea. Slowed breathing is called bradypnea. Labored or difficult breathing is known as dyspnea.Apnea can come and go and be temporary. This can occur with obstructive sleep apnea, for example. Prolonged apnea means a person has stopped breathing. If the heart is still active, the condition is known as respiratory arrest. This is a life-threatening event that requires immediate medical attention and first aid. Prolonged apnea with no heart activity in a person who is not responsive is called cardiac (or cardiopulmonary) arrest. In infants and children, the most common cause of cardiac arrest is respiratory arrest. In adults, the opposite usually occurs, cardiac arrest most often leads to respiratory arrest.

Most people take breathing for granted. People with certain illnesses may have breathing problems that they deal with on a regular basis. This article discusses first aid for someone who is having unexpected breathing problems. Breathing difficulties can range from: Being short of breath Being unable to take a deep breath and gasping for air Feeling like you are not getting enough airBreathing difficulty is almost always a medical emergency. An exception is feeling slightly winded from normal activity, such as exercise.

Breathing difficulty may involve: Difficult breathing Uncomfortable breathing Feeling like you are not getting enough airThere is no standard definition for difficulty breathing. Some people feel breathless with only mild exercise (for example, climbing stairs), even though they don't have a medical condition. Others may have advanced lung disease, but may never feel short of breath. Breathing difficulty is a subjective feeling; only the person feeling it can decide if it is present. Wheezing is one form of breathing difficulty in which you make a high-pitched sound when you breathe out.

Breathing difficulty while lying down is an abnormal condition in which a person has a problem breathing normally when lying flat. The head must be raised by sitting or standing to be able to breathe deeply or comfortably. A type of breathing difficulty while lying down is paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. This condition causes a person to wake up suddenly during the night feeling short of breath.This is a common complaint in people with some types of heart or lung problems. Sometimes the problem is subtle. People may only notice it when they realize that sleep is more comfortable with lots of pillows under their head, or their head in a propped-up position.

Bronchiectasis is a disease in which the large airways in the lungs are damaged. This causes the airways to become permanently wider. Bronchiectasis can be present at birth or infancy or develop later in life.Bronchiectasis is often caused by inflammation or infection of the airways that keeps coming back. Sometimes it begins in childhood after having a severe lung infection or inhaling a foreign object . Breathing in food particles can also lead to this condition. Other causes of bronchiectasis can include: Cystic fibrosis , a disease that causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the lungs Autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis or Sjögren syndrome Allergic lung diseases Leukemia and related cancers Immune deficiency syndromes Primary ciliary dyskinesia (another congenital disease) Infection with non-tuberculous mycobacteria

Bronchoscopy is a test to view the airways and diagnose lung disease. It may also be used during the treatment of some lung conditions.A bronchoscope is a device used to see the inside of the airways and lungs. The scope can be flexible or rigid. A flexible scope is almost always used. It is a tube less than one half inch (1 centimeter) wide and about 2 feet (60 centimeters) long. In rare cases, a rigid bronchoscope is used. You will likely get medicines through a vein (IV, or intravenously) to help you relax. Or, you may be asleep under general anesthesia , especially if a rigid scope is used. A numbing drug (anesthetic) will be sprayed in your mouth and throat. If bronchoscopy is done through your nose, numbing jelly will be placed in the nostril the tube goes through. The scope is gently inserted. It will likely make you cough at first. The coughing will stop as the numbing drug begins to work. Your health care provider may send saline solution through the tube. This washes the lungs and allows your provider to collect samples of lung cells, fluids, microbes and other materials inside the air sacs. This part of the procedure is called a lavage. Sometimes, tiny brushes, needles, or forceps may be passed through the bronchoscope to take very small tissue samples (biopsies) from your lungs. Your provider can also place a stent in your airway or view your lungs with ultrasound during the procedure. A stent is a small tube-like medical device. Ultrasound is a painless imaging method that allows your provider to see inside your body. Sometimes ultrasound is used to see the lymph nodes and tissues around your airways. At the end of the procedure, the scope is removed.

A chest CT (computed tomography) scan is an imaging method that uses x-rays to create cross-sectional pictures of the chest and upper abdomen.The test is done in the following way: You'll likely be asked to change into a hospital gown. You lie on a narrow table that slides into the center of the scanner. Once you are inside the scanner, the machine's x-ray beam rotates around you. You must be still during the exam, because movement causes blurred images. You may be told to hold your breath for short period of time. The complete scan takes 30 seconds to a few minutes. Certain CT scans require a special dye, called contrast, to be delivered into the body before the test starts. Contrast highlights specific areas inside the body and creates a clearer image. If your provider requests a CT scan with intravenous contrast, you will be given it through a vein (IV) in your arm or hand. A blood test to measure your kidney function may be done before the test. This test is to make sure your kidneys are healthy enough to filter the contrast. You may be given medicine to help you relax during the test.



A home apnea monitor is a machine used to monitor a baby's heart rate and breathing after coming home from the hospital. Apnea is breathing that slows down or stops from any cause. An alarm on the monitor goes off when your baby's heart rate or breathing slows or stops. The monitor is small and portable.A monitor may be needed when: Your baby has ongoing apnea Your baby has severe reflux Your baby needs to be on oxygen or a breathing machine The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that home monitors should not be used to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome ( SIDS ). Babies should be put on their backs or sides to sleep to reduce the chance of SIDS.

Pursed lip breathing helps you use less energy to breathe. It can help you relax. When you are short of breath, it helps you slow the pace of your breathing and can help you feel less short of breath. Use pursed lip breathing when you do things that make you short of breath, such as: Exercise Bend Lift Climb stairs Feel anxious You can practice pursed lip breathing anytime. Try to practice 4 or 5 times a day when you: Watch TV Use your computer Read a newspaperThe steps to do pursed lip breathing are: Relax the muscles in your neck and shoulders. Sit in a comfortable chair with your feet on the floor. Inhale slowly through your nose for 2 counts. Feel your belly get larger as you breathe in. Pucker your lips, as if you were going to whistle or blow out a candle. Exhale slowly through your lips for 4 or more counts. Exhale normally. DO NOT force the air out. DO NOT hold your breath when you are doing pursed lip breathing. Repeat these steps until your breathing slows.



Intercostal retractions occur when the muscles between the ribs pull inward. The movement is most often a sign that the person has a breathing problem. Intercostal retractions are a medical emergency.The wall of your chest is flexible. This helps you breathe normally. Stiff tissue called cartilage attaches your ribs to the breast bone (sternum). The intercostal muscles are the muscles between the ribs. During breathing, these muscles normally tighten and pull the rib cage up. Your chest expands and the lungs fill with air. Intercostal retractions are due to reduced air pressure inside your chest. This can happen if the upper airway (trachea) or small airways of the lungs (bronchioles) become partially blocked. As a result, the intercostal muscles are sucked inward, between the ribs, when you breathe. This is a sign of a blocked airway . Any health problem that causes a blockage in the airway will cause intercostal retractions.

Nasal flaring occurs when the nostrils widen while breathing. It is often a sign of trouble breathing.Nasal flaring is seen mostly in infants and younger children. Any condition that causes difficulty breathing can cause nasal flaring. Many causes of nasal flaring are not serious, but some can be life threatening. In young infants, nasal flaring can be a sign of respiratory distress . This is a serious lung condition that prevents enough oxygen from getting to the lungs and into the blood.

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is a condition in some obese people in which poor breathing leads to lower oxygen and higher carbon dioxide levels in the blood.The exact cause of OHS is not known. Researchers believe OHS results from a defect in the brain's control over breathing. Excess weight against the chest wall also makes it harder for the muscles to draw in a deep breath and to breathe quickly enough. This worsens the brain's breathing control. As a result, the blood contains too much carbon dioxide and not enough oxygen.

Someone who is very ill may have trouble breathing or feel as if they are not getting enough air. This condition is called shortness of breath. The medical term for this is dyspnea.Palliative care is a holistic approach to care that focuses on treating pain and symptoms and improving quality of life in people with serious illnesses and a limited life span.

Primary alveolar hypoventilation is a rare disorder in which a person does not take enough breaths per minute. The lungs and airways are normal.Normally, when the oxygen level in the blood is low or the carbon dioxide level is high, there is a signal from the brain to breathe more deeply or quickly. In people with primary alveolar hypoventilation, this change in breathing does not happen. The cause of this condition is unknown. Some people have a specific genetic defect. The disease mainly affects men 20 to 50 years old. It may also occur in children.

Pulmonary function tests are a group of tests that measure breathing and how well the lungs are functioning.Spirometry measures airflow. By measuring how much air you exhale, and how quickly you exhale, spirometry can evaluate a broad range of lung diseases. In a spirometry test, while you are sitting, you breathe into a mouthpiece that is connected to an instrument called a spirometer. The spirometer records the amount and the rate of air that you breathe in and out over a period of time. When standing, some numbers might be slightly different. For some of the test measurements, you can breathe normally and quietly. Other tests require forced inhalation or exhalation after a deep breath. Sometimes, you will be asked to inhale a different gas or a medicine to see how it changes your test results. Lung volume measurement can be done in two ways: The most accurate way is called body plethysmography. You sit in a clear airtight box that looks like a phone booth. The technologist asks you to breathe in and out of a mouthpiece. Changes in pressure inside the box help determine the lung volume. Lung volume can also be measured when you breathe nitrogen or helium gas through a tube for a certain period of time. The concentration of the gas in a chamber attached to the tube is measured to estimate the lung volume. To measure diffusion capacity , you breathe a harmless gas, called a tracer gas, for a very short time, often for only one breath. The concentration of the gas in the air you breathe out is measured. The difference in the amount of gas inhaled and exhaled measures how effectively gas travels from the lungs into the blood. This test allows the health care provider to estimate how well the lungs move oxygen from the air into the bloodstream.

A normal breathing rate for an adult at rest is 8 to 16 breaths per minute. For an infant, a normal rate is up to 44 breaths per minute. Tachypnea is the term that your health care provider uses to describe your breathing if it is too fast, especially if you have fast, shallow breathing from a lung disease or other medical cause. The term hyperventilation is usually used if you are taking rapid, deep breaths. This can be due to lung disease or because of anxiety or panic. The terms are sometimes used interchangeably.Shallow, rapid breathing has many possible medical causes, including: Asthma Blood clot in an artery in the lung Choking Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) and other chronic lung diseases Heart failure Infection in the smallest air passages of the lungs in children ( bronchiolitis ) Pneumonia or other lung infection Transient tachypnea of the newborn Anxiety and panic Other serious lung disease, such as interstitial lung disease or bronchiectasis

Stridor is an abnormal, high-pitched, musical breathing sound. It is caused by a blockage in the throat or voice box (larynx). It is most often heard when taking in a breath.Children are at higher risk of airway blockage because they have narrower airways than adults. In young children, stridor is a sign of airway blockage. It must be treated right away to prevent the airway from becoming completely closed. The airway can be blocked by an object, swollen tissues of the throat or upper airway, or a spasm of the airway muscles or the vocal cords.

Acquired tracheomalacia is a weakness and floppiness of the walls of the windpipe (trachea, or airway). It develops after birth. Congenital tracheomalacia is a related topic.Acquired tracheomalacia is very uncommon at any age. It occurs when normal cartilage in the wall of the windpipe begins to break down. This form of tracheomalacia may result: When large blood vessels put pressure on the airway As a complication after surgery to repair birth defects in the windpipe and esophagus (the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach) After having a breathing tube or trachea tube (tracheostomy) for a long time

Congenital tracheomalacia is weakness and floppiness of the walls of the windpipe (trachea). Congenital means it is present at birth. Acquired tracheomalacia is a related topic.Tracheomalacia in a newborn occurs when the cartilage in the windpipe has not developed properly. Instead of being rigid, the walls of the trachea are floppy. Because the windpipe is the main airway, breathing problems begin soon after birth. Congenital tracheomalacia is very uncommon.

Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) is a breathing disorder seen shortly after delivery in early term or late preterm babies. Transient means it is short-lived (most often less than 48 hours). Tachypnea means rapid breathing (faster than most newborns, who normally breathe 40 to 60 times per minute).As the baby grows in the womb, the lungs make a special fluid. This fluid fills the baby's lungs and helps them grow. When the baby is born at term, hormones released during labor tell the lungs to stop making this special fluid. The baby's lungs start removing or reabsorbing it. The first few breaths a baby takes after delivery fill the lungs with air and help to clear most of the remaining lung fluid. Leftover fluid in the lungs causes the baby to breathe rapidly. It is harder for the small air sacs of the lungs to stay open. TTN is more likely to occur in babies who were: Born before 38 completed weeks gestation (early term) Delivered by C-section, especially if labor has not already started Born to a mother with diabetes or asthma Twins Male sex

If you have breathing problems such as asthma or COPD, you can travel safely if you take a few precautions.It's easier to stay healthy while traveling if you are in good health before you go. Before traveling, you should talk with your health care provider if you have breathing problems and you: Are short of breath most of the time Get short of breath when you walk 150 feet (45 meters) or less Have been in the hospital for breathing problems recently Use oxygen at home, even if just at night or with exercise Also talk with your provider if you were in the hospital for your breathing problems and had: Pneumonia Chest surgery A collapsed lung Check with your provider if you plan to travel in a place at a high altitude (such as states like Colorado or Utah and countries like Peru or Ecuador).

The inside walls of the nose have 3 pairs of long thin bones covered with a layer of tissue that can expand. These bones are called nasal turbinates. Allergies or other nasal problems can cause the turbinates to swell and block airflow. Surgery can be done to fix blocked airways and improve your breathing.There are several types of turbinate surgery: Turbinectomy: All or part of the lower turbinate is taken out. This can be done in several different ways, but sometimes a tiny, high-speed device (microdebrider) is used to shave off the extra tissue. The surgery may be done through a lighted camera (endoscope) that is placed into the nose. You may have general anesthesia or local anesthesia with sedation, so you are asleep and pain-free during surgery. Turbinoplasty: A tool is placed in the nose to change the position of the turbinate. This is called the outfracture technique. Some of the tissue may also be shaved off. You may have general anesthesia or local anesthesia with sedation, so you are asleep and pain-free during surgery. Radiofrequency or laser ablation: A thin probe is placed into the nose. Laser light or radiofrequency energy goes through this tube and shrinks the turbinate tissue. The procedure can be done in the health care provider's office using local anesthesia.

Wheezing is a high-pitched whistling sound during breathing. It occurs when air moves through narrowed breathing tubes in the lungs.Wheezing is a sign that a person may be having breathing problems. The sound of wheezing is most obvious when breathing out (exhaling). It may also be heard when breathing in (inhaling). Wheezing most often comes from the small breathing tubes (bronchial tubes) deep in the lungs. But it may be due to a blockage in larger airways or in people with certain vocal cord problems.

Bronchitis is an inflammation of the bronchial tubes, the airways that carry air to your lungs. It causes a cough that often brings up mucus. It can also cause shortness of breath, wheezing, a low fever, and chest tightness. There are two main types of bronchitis: acute and chronic . Most cases of acute bronchitis get better within several days. But your cough can last for several weeks after the infection is gone. The same viruses that cause colds and the flu often cause acute bronchitis. These viruses spread through the air when people cough, or though physical contact (for example, on unwashed hands). Being exposed to tobacco smoke, air pollution, dusts, vapors, and fumes can also cause acute bronchitis. Less often, bacteria can also cause acute bronchitis. To diagnose acute bronchitis, your health care provider will ask about your symptoms and listen to your breathing. You may also have other tests. Treatments include rest, fluids, and aspirin (for adults) or acetaminophen to treat fever. A humidifier or steam can also help. You may need inhaled medicine to open your airways if you are wheezing. Antibiotics won't help if the cause is viral. You may get antibiotics if the cause is bacterial. NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute





What is chronic bronchitis? Chronic bronchitis is a type of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). COPD is a group of lung diseases that make it hard to breathe and get worse over time. The other main type of COPD is emphysema . Most people with COPD have both emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but how severe each type is can be different from person to person. Chronic bronchitis is inflammation (swelling) and irritation of the bronchial tubes. These tubes are the airways that carry air to and from the air sacs in your lungs. The irritation of the tubes causes mucus to build up. This mucus and the swelling of the tubes make it harder for your lungs to move oxygen in and carbon dioxide out of your body. What causes chronic bronchitis? The cause of chronic bronchitis is usually long-term exposure to irritants that damage your lungs and airways. In the United States, cigarette smoke is the main cause. Pipe, cigar, and other types of tobacco smoke can also cause chronic bronchitis, especially if you inhale them. Exposure to other inhaled irritants can contribute to chronic bronchitis. These include secondhand smoke , air pollution , and chemical fumes or dusts from the environment or workplace. Rarely, a genetic condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can play a role in causing chronic bronchitis. Who is at risk for chronic bronchitis? The risk factors for chronic bronchitis include: Smoking. This the main risk factor. Up to 75% of people who have chronic bronchitis smoke or used to smoke. Long-term exposure to other lung irritants , such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, and chemical fumes and dusts from the environment or workplace. Age. Most people who have chronic bronchitis are at least 40 years old when their symptoms begin. Genetics. This includes alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, which is a genetic condition. Also, smokers who get chronic bronchitis are more likely to get it if they have a family history of COPD. What are the symptoms of chronic bronchitis? At first, you may have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. As the disease gets worse, your symptoms usually become more severe. They can include: Frequent coughing or a cough that produces a lot mucus Wheezing A whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe Shortness of breath, especially with physical activity Tightness in your chest Some people with chronic bronchitis get frequent respiratory infections such as colds and the flu . In severe cases, chronic bronchitis can cause weight loss, weakness in your lower muscles, and swelling in your ankles, feet, or legs. How is chronic bronchitis diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis: A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms A family history Various tests, such as lung function tests , a chest x-ray or CT scan , and blood tests What are the treatments for chronic bronchitis? There is no cure for chronic bronchitis. However, treatments can help with symptoms, slow the progress of the disease, and improve your ability to stay active. There are also treatments to prevent or treat complications of the disease. Treatments include: Lifestyle changes , such as Quitting smoking if you are a smoker. This is the most important step you can take to treat chronic bronchitis. Avoiding secondhand smoke and places where you might breathe in other lung irritants Ask your health care provider for an eating plan that will meet your nutritional needs. Also ask about how much physical activity you can do. Physical activity can strengthen the muscles that help you breathe and improve your overall wellness. Medicines , such as Bronchodilators, which relax the muscles around your airways. This helps open your airways and makes breathing easier. Most bronchodilators are taken through an inhaler. In more severe cases, the inhaler may also contain steroids to reduce inflammation. Vaccines for the flu and pneumococcal pneumonia, since people with chronic bronchitis are at higher risk for serious problems from these diseases. Antibiotics if you get a bacterial or viral lung infection Oxygen therapy , if you have severe chronic bronchitis and low levels of oxygen in your blood. Oxygen therapy can help you breathe better. You may need extra oxygen all the time or only at certain times. Pulmonary rehabilitation , which is a program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic breathing problems. It may include An exercise program Disease management training Nutritional counseling Psychological counseling A lung transplant , as a last resort for people who have severe symptoms that have not gotten better with medicines If you have chronic bronchitis, it's important to know when and where to get help for your symptoms. You should get emergency care if you have severe symptoms, such as trouble catching your breath or talking. Call your health care provider if your symptoms are getting worse or if you have signs of an infection, such as a fever . Can chronic bronchitis be prevented? Since smoking causes most cases of chronic bronchitis, the best way to prevent it is to not smoke. It's also important to try to avoid lung irritants such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, chemical fumes, and dusts. NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute

What is COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)? COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) is a group of lung diseases that make it hard to breathe and get worse over time. Normally, the airways and air sacs in your lungs are elastic or stretchy. When you breathe in, the airways bring air to the air sacs. The air sacs fill up with air, like a small balloon. When you breathe out, the air sacs deflate, and the air goes out. If you have COPD, less air flows in and out of your airways because of one or more problems: The airways and air sacs in your lungs become less elastic The walls between many of the air sacs are destroyed The walls of the airways become thick and inflamed The airways make more mucus than usual and can become clogged What are the types of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)? COPD includes two main types: Emphysema affects the air sacs in your lungs, as well as the walls between them. They become damaged and are less elastic. Chronic bronchitis , in which the lining of your airways is constantly irritated and inflamed. This causes the lining to swell and make mucus.

Heart failure is a condition in which the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. Heart failure does not mean that your heart has stopped or is about to stop working. It means that your heart is not able to pump blood the way it should. It can affect one or both sides of the heart. The weakening of the heart's pumping ability causes: Blood and fluid to back up into the lungs The buildup of fluid in the feet, ankles and legs - called edema Tiredness and shortness of breath Common causes of heart failure are coronary artery disease , high blood pressure and diabetes . It is more common in people who are 65 years old or older, African Americans, people who are overweight, and people who have had a heart attack. Men have a higher rate of heart failure than women. Your doctor will diagnose heart failure by doing a physical exam and heart tests. Treatment includes treating the underlying cause of your heart failure, medicines, and heart transplantation if other treatments fail. NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute

When you breathe, your lungs take in oxygen from the air and deliver it to the bloodstream. The cells in your body need oxygen to work and grow.  During a normal day, you breathe nearly 25,000 times. People with lung disease have difficulty breathing. Millions of people in the U.S. have lung disease. If all types of lung disease are lumped together, it is the number three killer in the United States. The term lung disease refers to many disorders affecting the lungs, such as asthma , COPD , infections like influenza , pneumonia and tuberculosis , lung cancer , and many other breathing problems . Some lung diseases can lead to respiratory failure . Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health

Sleep apnea is a common disorder that causes your breathing to stop or get very shallow. Breathing pauses can last from a few seconds to minutes. They may occur 30 times or more an hour. The most common type is obstructive sleep apnea. It causes your airway to collapse or become blocked during sleep. Normal breathing starts again with a snort or choking sound. People with sleep apnea often snore loudly. However, not everyone who snores has sleep apnea. You are more at risk for sleep apnea if you are overweight, male, or have a family history or small airways.  Children with enlarged tonsils or adenoids may also get it. Doctors diagnose sleep apnea based on medical and family histories, a physical exam, and sleep study results. When your sleep is interrupted throughout the night, you can be drowsy during the day. People with sleep apnea are at higher risk for car crashes, work-related accidents, and other medical problems. If you have it, it is important to get treatment. Lifestyle changes, mouthpieces, surgery, and breathing devices can treat sleep apnea in many people. NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute











What are antidepressants? Antidepressants are prescription medicines to treat depression. Depression is more than feeling a little sad or "blue" for a few days. It's a very common, serious medical illness that affects your mood and general mental health It can make you feel tired, hopeless, worried, or fearful. It can change your thinking, sleeping, and eating. Depression may make some people think about ending their lives. But antidepressants can help many people who have depression. Researchers think antidepressants may help improve the way your brain uses certain chemicals that control mood or stress. Are antidepressants used for other conditions? A health care provider may prescribe antidepressants for anxiety , chronic pain , or insomnia . Sometimes providers also prescribe antidepressants for other conditions. What are the different types of antidepressants? There are many types of antidepressants. Each one works differently. Providers usually prescribe newer antidepressants first because they don't cause as many side effects as older types. They also seem to help more kinds of depression and anxiety problems. Most of the newer antidepressants belong to one of these three groups: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) Atypical antidepressants, which are newer antidepressants that don't fit into the other groups If these antidepressants don't help, your provider might suggest one of the older antidepressants. The older types include tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), tetracyclics, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Even though these antidepressants may cause more serious side effects, the benefits may outweigh the risks for some people. Which type of antidepressant is right for me? Our bodies and brains all work differently. That means one antidepressant won't work for everyone.  You may need to try two or more medicines before you find one that works for you. Your provider will work with you to choose the best option to try first. You'll consider questions such as: Which symptoms bother you most? Some antidepressants may do a better job helping specific symptoms, such as trouble sleeping. What other medicines and supplements do you take? Some antidepressants can cause problems if you take them with certain medicines and herbs. Did a certain antidepressant work well for a close relative? An antidepressant that helped a parent, brother, or sister could be a good choice for you, too. Do you have other health conditions? Certain antidepressants can make some other conditions better or worse. Any other conditions that you have will be part of choosing your depression treatment. Are you pregnant, planning for pregnancy, or breastfeeding? If so, your provider will help you find a way to treat your depression that's safe for you and your baby. How long do antidepressants take to work? Antidepressants usually take 4 to 8 weeks to work, so you'll need to be patient. You may notice that some problems, such as sleeping and eating, get better before your mood improves. That's a good sign. You may just need to give the medicine a little more time to do its job. Sometimes an antidepressant helps at first, but symptoms return while you're still taking it. But there's usually another one you can try. To get more relief from depression, your provider may suggest combining two antidepressants, using another kind of medicine with an antidepressant, or adding talk therapy or other approaches to improve your mental health . How long will I need to take an antidepressant? When an antidepressant starts to work, you and your provider can decide how long you need to stay on it. The typical length of treatment is 6 to 12 months, but some people may stay on antidepressants for much longer. What are the side effects of antidepressants? Not everyone has side effects from antidepressants. But if you do have them, they're usually mild and may get better over time as your body gets used to the new medicine. The most common side effects from antidepressants include: Nausea and vomiting Weight gain Diarrhea Sleepiness Sexual problems, such as a lack of desire or ability to have sex When thinking about side effects, it's important to remember that there are also risks from not treating depression. Your provider can help you think through the pros and cons of all your options. If you have any side effects from antidepressants, your provider may suggest ways to manage them while you wait to see if the antidepressant will work. If the side effects bother you too much, you may need to change antidepressants. But you should never change your dose or stop taking an antidepressant on your own. If you have serious problems or notice any changes that worry you, such as new or worsening symptoms, unusual changes in your mood, or you start acting differently, call your provider right away. In some cases, children, teenagers, and young adults under 25 may be more likely to think about hurting or killing themselves when starting antidepressants or when the dose is changed. Get medical help right away if this happens. What can I do to take antidepressants safely? Antidepressants are generally safe when you use them correctly: Tell your provider about everything you take. That includes medicines, herbs, supplements, and over-the-counter medicines you take, such as pain relievers and decongestants. Be honest about recreational drugs and alcohol, too. Try to get all your medicines from the same pharmacy. That way the pharmacist can warn you and your provider if you take medicines that may cause problems when used together. Follow all instructions about how to take your medicine. Talk with your provider if side effects bother you. Never stop taking antidepressants without your provider's help. Stopping too fast may make depression come back. You could even make your condition worse. To stop antidepressants safely, you need to give your body time to get used to being without the medicine. Your provider can tell you the safest way to go off an antidepressant. NIH: National Institute of Mental Health

Serotonin syndrome (SS) is a potentially life-threatening drug reaction. It causes the body to have too much serotonin, a chemical produced by nerve cells.SS most often occurs when two medicines that affect the body's level of serotonin are taken together at the same time. The medicines cause too much serotonin to be released or to remain in the brain area. For example, you can develop this syndrome if you take migraine medicines called triptans together with antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and selective serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSNRIs). Common SSRIs include citalopram (Celexa), sertraline (Zoloft), fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), and escitalopram (Lexapro). SSNRIs include duloxetine (Cymbalta), venlafaxine (Effexor), Desvenlafaxine (Pristiq), Milnacipran (Savella), and Levomilnacipran (Fetzima). Common triptans include sumatriptan (Imitrex), zolmitriptan (Zomig), frovatriptan (Frova), rizatriptan (Maxalt), almotriptan (Axert), naratriptan (Amerge), and eletriptan (Relpax). If you take these medicines, be sure to read the warning on the packaging. It tells you about the potential risk of serotonin syndrome. However, do not stop taking your medicine. Talk to your doctor about your concerns first. SS is more likely to occur on starting or increasing the medicine.

Agitation is an unpleasant state of extreme arousal. An agitated person may feel stirred up, excited, tense, confused, or irritable.Agitation can come on suddenly or over time. It can last for a few minutes, for weeks, or even months. Pain, stress, and fever can all increase agitation. Agitation by itself may not be a sign of a health problem. But if other symptoms occur, it can be a sign of disease. Agitation with a change in alertness (altered consciousness) can be a sign of delirium . Delirium has a medical cause and should be checked by a health care provider right away.

Fever is the temporary increase in the body's temperature in response to a disease or illness. A child has a fever when the temperature is at or above one of these levels: 100.4°F (38°C) measured in the bottom (rectally) 99.5°F (37.5°C) measured in the mouth (orally) 99°F (37.2°C) measured under the arm (axillary) An adult probably has a fever when the temperature is above 99°F to 99.5°F (37.2°C to 37.5°C), depending on the time of day.Normal body temperature may change during any given day. It is usually highest in the evening. Other factors that may affect body temperature are: A woman's menstrual cycle. In the second part of this cycle, her temperature may go up by 1 degree or more. Physical activity, strong emotion, eating, heavy clothing, medicines, high room temperature, and high humidity can all increase body temperature. Fever is an important part of the body's defense against infection. Most bacteria and viruses that cause infections in people thrive best at 98.6°F (37°C). Many infants and children develop high fevers with mild viral illnesses. Although a fever signals that a battle might be going on in the body, the fever is fighting for, not against the person. Brain damage from a fever generally will not occur unless the fever is over 107.6°F (42°C). Untreated fevers caused by infection will seldom go over 105°F (40.6°C) unless the child is overdressed or in a hot place. Febrile seizures do occur in some children. Most febrile seizures are over quickly and do not mean your child has epilepsy. These seizures also do not cause any permanent harm. Unexplained fevers that continue for days or weeks are called fevers of undetermined origin (FUO).

Separation anxiety in children is a developmental stage in which the child is anxious when separated from the primary caregiver (usually the mother).As infants grow, their emotions and reactions to the world around them seem to occur in a predictable order. Before 8 months, infants are so new to the world that they lack a sense of what is normal and safe and what may be dangerous. As a result, new settings or people seem to not frighten them. From 8 to 14 months, children often become frightened when they meet new people or visit new places. They recognize their parents as familiar and safe. When separated from their parents, they feel threatened and unsafe. Separation anxiety is a normal stage as a child grows and develops. It helped keep our ancestors alive and helps children learn how to master the world around them. It usually ends when the child is around 2 years old. At this age, toddlers begin to understand that parents may be out of sight now, but will return later. It's also normal for them to test their independence. To get over separation anxiety, children need to: Feel safe in their home. Trust people other than their parents. Trust that their parents will return. Even after children have mastered this stage, separation anxiety may return in times of stress. Most children will feel some degree of separation anxiety when in unfamiliar situations, most often when separated from their parents. When children are in situations (such as hospitals) and are under stress (such as illness or pain), they seek the safety, comfort, and protection of their parents. Since anxiety can worsen pain, staying with a child as much as possible can reduce the pain.
